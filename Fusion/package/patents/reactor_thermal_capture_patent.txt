\begin{abstract}
A thermal management and first-wall protection system designed for high-repetition-rate (kHz--MHz) micro-scale fusion reactors. The invention addresses the challenge of capturing the pulsed thermal and particle load from continuous micro-explosions without ablating or fatigue-cracking a structural vessel, while maintaining optical access and a clear target injection path. The system employs a regenerating liquid metal first wall formed as (i) a liquid metal curtain (e.g., a laminar jet sheet or jet array) and/or (ii) a porous refractory first wall (e.g., porous tungsten) continuously wetted by a liquid metal film. The liquid layer absorbs X-ray flux and charged particle debris, damps shock, and transports heat to an external heat exchanger. In some embodiments the liquid metal is shaped and stabilized via vortex flow and/or magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) forces to maintain film thickness and to prevent intrusion into beam ports. The geometry is adapted to compact "Fusion Engine" architectures in which targets are delivered as a stream of micron-scale droplets and pulses occur at high repetition rates, requiring surface regeneration on time scales shorter than the pulse period.
\end{abstract}

\section{Technical Field}
The present disclosure relates to nuclear fusion reactor engineering, specifically to first-wall protection and heat extraction systems for inertial confinement fusion (ICF) devices operating at high repetition rates.

\section{Background}
In traditional ICF (e.g., NIF), the reactor chamber is large (meters in diameter) to dilute the energy flux from a single massive explosion. In the "Fusion Engine" architecture proposed by Recognition Science, the reactor is compact (centimeters to tens of centimeters) but operates at high frequency (1 kHz - 1 MHz). This creates a continuous, high-intensity thermal load on the inner wall, similar to the exhaust of a rocket engine but in a vacuum.

Solid walls (steel, tungsten) would rapidly erode due to thermal cycling, sputtering from ion impact, and X-ray ablation. Existing liquid wall concepts for large tokamaks or heavy-ion fusion are often gravity-driven and too slow to clear the chamber or regenerate the surface between kHz pulses.

Additionally, micro-scale architectures impose constraints not present in large chambers: (i) optical beam ports and diagnostic windows must survive line-of-sight X-ray and debris flux; (ii) a central axis may be reserved for droplet target injection; and (iii) pumping capacity and gas loads are limited, motivating liquid-based capture rather than gas buffering.

\section{Summary}
The invention provides a "Dynamic Liquid First Wall" tailored for compact, high-frequency operation.

\subsection*{Core Concept}
A high-velocity liquid metal flow is injected tangentially along the inner surface of the spherical or cylindrical reaction chamber. Centrifugal force (in a vortex flow) or capillary action (in a porous mesh) keeps the liquid adhered to the wall, preventing it from interfering with the laser path or fuel droplet trajectory. The liquid absorbs the fusion energy and is continuously cycled out to a heat exchanger.

\subsection*{Key Advantages}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.2em]
    \item \textbf{Ablation Resistance}: The liquid surface is self-healing. Any material vaporized by a micro-explosion is instantly replaced by fresh flow.
    \item \textbf{Compactness}: The high heat capacity of liquid metal allows the chamber radius to be small ($< 20$ cm) while handling megawatt-scale thermal power.
    \item \textbf{Vapor Suppression}: The flowing liquid acts as a getter, pumping vacuum contaminants and fusion ash (Helium) out of the reaction zone.
    \item \textbf{Shock Damping}: The liquid layer attenuates the acoustic shock waves from the fusion pulses, protecting the outer steel vessel.
\end{itemize}

\section{Detailed Description}

\subsection{Embodiment 1: The Vortex Wall (Swirl Film)}
In this embodiment, liquid metal (e.g., Li, PbLi, Sn, SnLi, or other eutectics) is injected tangentially at the top of a cylindrical or spherical chamber. The flow spirals downward, held against the wall by centrifugal force.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Flow Velocity}: $> 5$ m/s (non-limiting; may exceed 10 m/s) to ensure adhesion and rapid heat removal.
    \item \textbf{Thickness}: 0.5 mm--20 mm effective thickness (non-limiting).
    \item \textbf{Beam Ports}: The vortex flow naturally leaves the central axis clear for the fuel droplet stream. Laser ports are protected by magnetic shutters or gas puffs, or the laser enters through the open top vortex core.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Embodiment 2: The Wetted Porous Refractory First Wall}
In this embodiment, the inner wall is lined with a porous refractory matrix (e.g., porous tungsten, tungsten mesh, or sintered ceramic). Liquid metal is pumped through the wall from behind, weeping out to form a continuously renewed thin film on the surface.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Stability}: Capillary forces hold the liquid against gravity, allowing arbitrary chamber orientation.
    \item \textbf{Surface Renewal}: The flow rate is matched to the evaporation rate induced by the fusion pulses.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Embodiment 3: Liquid Metal Curtain (Jet Sheet)}
In this embodiment, a ring or array of nozzles generates one or more laminar sheets of liquid metal spanning a portion of the chamber interior to intercept debris and X-rays before they reach a structural wall. The curtain may be arranged to leave a clear aperture along the axis for droplet injection and to preserve optical access. The curtain may be operated as a closed loop in which the liquid is collected, degassed, filtered, and recirculated.

\subsection{Embodiment 4: MHD Shaping and Port Protection (Non-Limiting)}
In some embodiments, MHD forces are used to shape and stabilize the liquid film or curtain using magnetic fields and induced currents, reducing splashing and maintaining a controlled thickness near beam ports. Beam ports may include sacrificial baffles, rotating shutters, and/or local gas puffs synchronized to the pulse train to reduce line-of-sight deposition.

\subsection{Thermal Cycle}
The heated liquid metal exits the bottom of the chamber and passes through:
1.  \textbf{De-gassing Unit}: Removes Helium ash and unburned fuel vapor.
2.  \textbf{Heat Exchanger}: Transfers heat to a secondary loop (e.g., supercritical CO2 or steam) for power generation.
3.  \textbf{Pump}: Returns the cooled metal to the injector.
In some embodiments, the pump comprises an electromagnetic pump compatible with liquid metal operation. In D-T embodiments, tritium breeding and extraction subsystems may be incorporated.

\subsection{Filtration, Diagnostics, and Flow Control (Non-Limiting)}
In some embodiments, the circulation loop includes filtration and contamination control to remove particulates generated by erosion, sputtering, or chemical reactions. The system may include sensors to monitor at least one of: liquid metal temperature, flow rate, pressure, electrical conductivity, film thickness, or optical transmission at beam ports. A controller may modulate flow rate, injection pressure, magnetic field strength (for MHD shaping), and/or port protection timing based on measured heat load and pulse repetition rate.
