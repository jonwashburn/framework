## Magic Number Derivation Status (Ledger Topology)

**Owner:** Jonathan Washburn  
**Date:** 2026-01-19  
**Goal:** upgrade magic numbers from a hardcoded list to a theorem output of an explicit ledger topology model.

This tracks Phase **FQ1** in `planning/FUSION_FISSION_RESEARCH_EXECUTION_PLAN.md`.

### 1. Current state

- **Existing module:** `IndisputableMonolith/Nuclear/MagicNumbers.lean`
  - Defines `magicNumbers : List ℕ := [2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, 126]`
  - Provides membership lemmas and `isDoublyMagic`
  - Contains narrative claiming ledger-topology forcing, but does **not** yet derive the sequence.

- **New scaffold module:** `IndisputableMonolith/Nuclear/MagicNumbersDerivation.lean`
  - Provides a generic closure pipeline (`closuresOfGaps`)
  - Provides a finite `ShellModel` interface + canonical instance matching the observed list
  - Introduces `LedgerGapRule` as the interface for the *real* derivation (gap rule constrained by ledger axioms)

---

### 2. Open work items

#### FQ1.1 — Define a minimal ledger topology object (Lean)

- **Target file:** `IndisputableMonolith/Nuclear/MagicNumbersDerivation.lean`
- **Output:** a structure (or axioms) encoding a ledger closure mechanism, small enough to audit.

#### FQ1.2 — Define “closure points” and “shell capacities”

- A closure predicate `isClosure : ℕ → Prop`
- A derived sequence `closures : List ℕ` (or `Nat → Nat`) generated by the closure rule

#### FQ1.3 — Prove reproduction of observed sequence up to 126

- Theorem: derived closures produce `[2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, 126]` (up to a specified index)
- Quality gate: no `sorry`, no untracked axioms

#### FQ1.4 — Predictive extensions

- Optional: derive/justify candidate next closures (e.g. `N=184`) with explicit premises

---

### 3. Hypothesis management

Any physical/geometric assumptions required to produce the sequence must be:
- stated as explicit hypotheses (minimal list)
- logged in `planning/AXIOM_REDUCTION_STRATEGY.md` (if they become permanent)

---

### 4. Deliverables checklist

- [x] `IndisputableMonolith/Nuclear/MagicNumbersDerivation.lean` exists
- [x] closure definition + derived sequence exists
- [x] proof that derived sequence matches observed list up to 126 (canonical model)
- [x] compatibility lemma: derived `isMagic` implies current `Nuclear.MagicNumbers.isMagic` (canonical model)

**Important:** the above are the *scaffold* milestones; the remaining work is replacing the canonical gap list with a derivation from minimal ledger axioms.
