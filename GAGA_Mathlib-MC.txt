Based on my search of the mathlib4 codebase, here's the current status of GAGA-related formalizations:

## What Has Been Done

**Valuative Criteria**: The valuative criterion for proper morphisms is available as `AlgebraicGeometry.IsProper.eq_valuativeCriterion`. [1](#0-0) 

**Projective Spectrum (Proj)**: There is a substantial formalization of `Proj` as a scheme, including the construction of Proj as a locally ringed space and proofs that it is a scheme. [2](#0-1) 

**Analytic Functions**: There is a general theory of analytic functions (functions representable by convergent power series) with predicates like `AnalyticAt`, `AnalyticOn`, and `AnalyticOnNhd`, including complex-specific results.

**Homological Algebra Infrastructure**: There is extensive infrastructure for homological algebra, including chain complexes, derived categories, and various cohomology theories, though not yet applied to sheaves on schemes.

## What Is Missing

**Chow's Lemma**: Not yet formalized. While "Chow's theorem" is tracked in the theorem database, it has no formalization yet. [3](#0-2) 

**GAGA Theorem**: Not formalized.

**Complex Analytic Spaces**: While analytic functions are defined, there is no formal definition of complex analytic spaces as geometric objects (in the sense of complex manifolds or analytic varieties).

**Analytification Functor**: Not found in the codebase.

**O(1) / Twisting Sheaf**: Despite having Proj, the twisting sheaf O(1) for projective spaces is not yet available.

**Čech Cohomology for Schemes**: Only the Čech nerve construction exists [4](#0-3) , but there is no working theory of Čech cohomology on schemes.

**Cartan's Theorems A and B**: Not formalized yet.

**Sheaf Cohomology on Schemes**: While the infrastructure for sheaves on schemes exists (including Zariski and étale topologies), there is no explicit sheaf cohomology functor or derived functor theory for schemes yet.

## Summary

To work toward GAGA, the most urgent missing pieces are:
1. Complex analytic spaces as geometric objects
2. The analytification functor
3. Čech cohomology (or another cohomology theory) for schemes
4. O(1) and basic facts about projective spaces
5. Coherent sheaf cohomology on projective varieties

The valuative criterion being available is good news for foundational work on morphisms of schemes. The existing Proj construction provides a starting point for projective geometry, though much work remains on line bundles and sheaf operations on projective spaces.

# Proj as a scheme

This file is to prove that `Proj` is a scheme.

## Notation

* `Proj`      : `Proj` as a locally ringed space
* `Proj.T`    : the underlying topological space of `Proj`
* `Proj| U`   : `Proj` restricted to some open set `U`
* `Proj.T| U` : the underlying topological space of `Proj` restricted to open set `U`
* `pbo f`     : basic open set at `f` in `Proj`
* `Spec`      : `Spec` as a locally ringed space
* `Spec.T`    : the underlying topological space of `Spec`
* `sbo g`     : basic open set at `g` in `Spec`
* `A⁰_x`      : the degree zero part of localized ring `Aₓ`

## Implementation

In `Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/ProjectiveSpectrum/StructureSheaf.lean`, we have given `Proj` a
structure sheaf so that `Proj` is a locally ringed space. In this file we will prove that `Proj`
equipped with this structure sheaf is a scheme. We achieve this by using an affine cover by basic
open sets in `Proj`, more specifically:

1. We prove that `Proj` can be covered by basic open sets at homogeneous elements of positive
    degree.
2. We prove that for any homogeneous element `f : A` of positive degree `m`, `Proj.T | (pbo f)` is
    homeomorphic to `Spec.T A⁰_f`:
  - forward direction `toSpec`:
    for any `x : pbo f`, i.e. a relevant homogeneous prime ideal `x`, send it to
    `A⁰_f ∩ span {g / 1 | g ∈ x}` (see `ProjIsoSpecTopComponent.ToSpec.carrier`). This ideal is
    prime, the proof is in `ProjIsoSpecTopComponent.ToSpec.toFun`. The fact that this function
    is continuous is found in `ProjIsoSpecTopComponent.toSpec`
  - backward direction `fromSpec`:
    for any `q : Spec A⁰_f`, we send it to `{a | ∀ i, aᵢᵐ/fⁱ ∈ q}`; we need this to be a
    homogeneous prime ideal that is relevant.
    * This is in fact an ideal, the proof can be found in
      `ProjIsoSpecTopComponent.FromSpec.carrier.asIdeal`;
    * This ideal is also homogeneous, the proof can be found in
      `ProjIsoSpecTopComponent.FromSpec.carrier.asIdeal.homogeneous`;
    * This ideal is relevant, the proof can be found in
      `ProjIsoSpecTopComponent.FromSpec.carrier.relevant`;
    * This ideal is prime, the proof can be found in
      `ProjIsoSpecTopComponent.FromSpec.carrier.asIdeal.prime`.
    Hence we have a well-defined function `Spec.T A⁰_f → Proj.T | (pbo f)`, this function is called
    `ProjIsoSpecTopComponent.FromSpec.toFun`. But to prove the continuity of this function, we need
    to prove `fromSpec ∘ toSpec` and `toSpec ∘ fromSpec` are both identities; these are achieved in
    `ProjIsoSpecTopComponent.fromSpec_toSpec` and `ProjIsoSpecTopComponent.toSpec_fromSpec`.
3. Then we construct a morphism of locally ringed spaces `α : Proj| (pbo f) ⟶ Spec.T A⁰_f` as the
    following: by the Gamma-Spec adjunction, it is sufficient to construct a ring map
    `A⁰_f → Γ(Proj, pbo f)` from the ring of homogeneous localization of `A` away from `f` to the
    local sections of structure sheaf of projective spectrum on the basic open set around `f`.
    The map `A⁰_f → Γ(Proj, pbo f)` is constructed in `awayToΓ` and is defined by sending
    `s ∈ A⁰_f` to the section `x ↦ s` on `pbo f`.

## Main Definitions and Statements

For a homogeneous element `f` of degree `m`
* `ProjIsoSpecTopComponent.toSpec`: the continuous map between `Proj.T| pbo f` and `Spec.T A⁰_f`
  defined by sending `x : Proj| (pbo f)` to `A⁰_f ∩ span {g / 1 | g ∈ x}`. We also denote this map
  as `ψ`.
* `ProjIsoSpecTopComponent.ToSpec.preimage_eq`: for any `a: A`, if `a/f^m` has degree zero,
  then the preimage of `sbo a/f^m` under `toSpec f` is `pbo f ∩ pbo a`.

If we further assume `m` is positive
* `ProjIsoSpecTopComponent.fromSpec`: the continuous map between `Spec.T A⁰_f` and `Proj.T| pbo f`
  defined by sending `q` to `{a | aᵢᵐ/fⁱ ∈ q}` where `aᵢ` is the `i`-th coordinate of `a`.
  We also denote this map as `φ`
* `projIsoSpecTopComponent`: the homeomorphism `Proj.T| pbo f ≅ Spec.T A⁰_f` obtained by `φ` and
  `ψ`.
* `ProjectiveSpectrum.Proj.toSpec`: the morphism of locally ringed spaces between `Proj| pbo f`
  and `Spec A⁰_f` corresponding to the ring map `A⁰_f → Γ(Proj, pbo f)` under the Gamma-Spec
  adjunction defined by sending `s` to the section `x ↦ s` on `pbo f`.

Finally,
* `AlgebraicGeometry.Proj`: for any `ℕ`-graded ring `A`, `Proj A` is locally affine, hence is a
  scheme.
