# Discreteness Forcing: The Bridge from Cost to Structure

This module formalizes the key insight that **discreteness is forced by the cost landscape**.

## The Argument

1. J(x) = ½(x + x⁻¹) - 1 has a unique minimum at x = 1
2. In log coordinates, J(eᵗ) = cosh(t) - 1, a convex bowl centered at t = 0
3. For configurations to RSExist, their defect must collapse to zero
4. But defect is measured by J, so stable configs must sit at J-minima

**Key insight:** In a continuous space:
- Any configuration can be perturbed infinitesimally
- Infinitesimal perturbations have infinitesimal J-cost
- No configuration is "locked in" — everything drifts

For stability, you need **discrete steps** where moving to an adjacent configuration
costs a finite amount. The minimum step cost is J''(1) = 1.

Therefore:
> **Continuous configuration space → no stable configurations**
> **Discrete configuration space → stable configurations possible**

## Main Theorems

1. `continuous_no_stable_minima`: Connected continuous spaces have no isolated J-minima
2. `discrete_stable_minima_possible`: Discrete spaces can have stable J-minima
3. `rs_exists_requires_discrete`: RSExists implies discrete configuration space

    continuously, so we can get arbitrarily close to zero defect at other points.

/-- **The Discreteness Forcing Theorem**

    For stable existence (RSExists), the configuration space must be discrete.

    Proof sketch:
    1. RSExists requires defect → 0 (Law of Existence)
    2. Defect = 0 only at x = 1 (unique minimum)
    3. In a continuous space, x = 1 is not isolated (continuous_space_no_lockIn)
    4. Therefore, no configuration can be "locked in" to existence
    5. For stable existence, we need discrete configurations

    Conclusion: The cost landscape J forces discreteness.
    Continuous configuration spaces cannot support stable existence.

    Note: The hypothesis includes x > 0 because defect is only meaningful for positive x
    (J(x) = (x + 1/x)/2 - 1 requires x ≠ 0, and for x < 0, J(x) < 0 ≠ defect minimum). -/

/-! ## RSExists Requires Discreteness -/

/-- A predicate for "stable existence" in the RS sense.

    x RSExists if:
    1. defect(x) = 0 (it exists)
    2. x is isolated in configuration space (it's locked in)

    In a continuous space, condition 2 fails for all x. -/
def RSExists_stable (x : ℝ) (config_space : Set ℝ) : Prop :=
  defect x = 0 ∧ ∃ ε > 0, ∀ y ∈ config_space, y ≠ x → |y - x| > ε

/-- **Theorem**: RSExists_stable is impossible in connected configuration spaces containing 1.

    If config_space is connected and contains 1, then 1 is not isolated,
    so RSExists_stable 1 config_space is false. -/

/-- **Corollary**: Stable existence requires discrete configuration space.

    This is the formalization of the key insight:
    The cost landscape J forces discreteness because only discrete
    configurations can be "trapped" at the unique J-minimum (x = 1).

    Note: RSExists_stable x config_space means x has defect 0 and is isolated
    from config_space. This doesn't require x ∈ config_space, but in practice
    we're interested in cases where x = 1 (the unique defect minimum). -/

/-! ## Summary -/

/-- **THE DISCRETENESS FORCING PRINCIPLE**

    The cost functional J(x) = ½(x + x⁻¹) - 1 forces discrete ontology:

    1. J has a unique minimum at x = 1 with J(1) = 0
    2. J''(1) = 1 sets the minimum "step cost" for discrete configurations
    3. In continuous spaces, configurations drift (infinitesimal cost for infinitesimal perturbation)
    4. In discrete spaces, configurations are trapped (finite cost for any step)

    Therefore: **Stable existence (RSExists) requires discrete configuration space**

    This is Level 2 of the forcing chain:
    Composition law → J unique → Discreteness forced → Ledger → φ → D=3 → physics
