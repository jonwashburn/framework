# Law of Existence: Rigorous Formalization

This module provides a **sharp, literal** formalization of the Law of Existence:

  **x exists ⟺ defect(x) = 0**

## Key Theorems

1. `defect_zero_iff_one`: defect(x) = 0 ⟺ x = 1
2. `law_of_existence`: Exists x ⟺ DefectCollapse x
3. `unity_unique_existent`: 1 is the unique existent
4. `nothing_cannot_exist`: ∀ C, ∃ ε > 0, ∀ x ∈ (0,ε), defect(x) > C
5. `existence_economically_inevitable`: ∃! x > 0, x minimizes defect
