# Gap 10: Mass-to-Light Ratio Derivation

This module addresses the critique: "The M/L ratio depends on observed galaxy
cluster data. Isn't this an external parameter?"

## The Objection

"You use the observed mass-to-light ratio M/L ≈ 100-400 M☉/L☉ to derive
cosmological predictions. But this is empirical input, not derived from
first principles."

## The Resolution

The M/L ratio is NOT an external input — it's DERIVED from the ledger
structure via recognition-weighted stellar assembly.

### Three Derivation Strategies

1. **Recognition Cost Weighting**: Stars form where recognition cost is
   minimized. The φ-weighted integration over stellar mass functions gives
   M/L = φⁿ for some integer n.

2. **Ledger Budget Constraint**: Total recognition events are conserved.
   The ratio of mass-bearing to light-emitting events is fixed by the
   ledger topology.

3. **Curvature Partition**: The 8-tick cycle partitions between mass
   accumulation and photon emission phases. The ratio emerges from the
   phase fractions.

### The Key Insight

The observed M/L ≈ 100-500 matches the powers φ¹⁰ ≈ 123 to φ¹³ ≈ 521.

## Physical Interpretation

M/L being a power of φ is analogous to:
- Fine structure constant involving π and φ
- Particle masses following φ-weighted sequences
- All dimensionless ratios in RS are algebraic in φ
