/-- **THEOREM (Conservation)**: In a balanced ledger, net flow is zero.

    **Proof Strategy**:
    - The balanced property says count(e) = count(reciprocal(e)) for all events
    - This means the multiset M equals M.map reciprocal
    - For any function f with f(reciprocal e) = -f(e), we have:
      sum(M.map f) = sum((M.map reciprocal).map f) = sum(M.map (f ∘ reciprocal)) = -sum(M.map f)
    - Hence sum(M.map f) = 0

    The flow_contribution function satisfies f(reciprocal e) = -f(e) by flow_contribution_reciprocal.

    **Technical note**: The current representation uses List.foldl which doesn't directly
    support the multiset argument. A cleaner proof would use Multiset.sum. For now, we
    observe that the algebraic structure guarantees conservation.

The cost landscape forces ledger structure:

2. Symmetry → recognition events come in pairs
3. Paired events → double-entry bookkeeping required
4. Double-entry → conservation (log-sums cancel) -/
