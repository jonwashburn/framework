# φ Necessity Certificate (Self-Similarity Forces Golden Ratio)

This certificate packages the proof that the golden ratio φ = (1+√5)/2 is
**mathematically necessary** rather than an arbitrary choice.

## Key Result

Self-similarity structure with:
- preferred_scale > 1
- level1 = preferred_scale × level0
- level2 = preferred_scale × level1
- level2 = level1 + level0 (Fibonacci-like recurrence)

**forces** preferred_scale² = preferred_scale + 1, which has φ as its unique positive solution.

## Why this matters for the certificate chain

This certificate addresses the "numerology objection" at a deeper level than
`PhiAlternativesFailCert`. While that certificate showed e, π, √2, √3, √5 fail
the selection criterion, this certificate shows WHY φ satisfies it:

1. **Self-similarity implies the golden polynomial**: Any scale factor satisfying
   the Fibonacci recurrence at three consecutive levels must satisfy x² = x + 1.

2. **Uniqueness among positive reals**: The polynomial x² - x - 1 = 0 has exactly
   one positive root, which is φ.

3. **No free parameters**: The derivation uses only structural constraints, not
   empirical fitting or arbitrary choices.

## Proven Results

1. `preferred_scale_fixed_point`: Self-similarity → scale² = scale + 1
2. `self_similarity_forces_phi`: Self-similarity → scale = φ
3. `phi_is_mathematically_necessary`: (x > 1 ∧ x² = x + 1) → x = φ

/-- Verification predicate: φ is mathematically forced by self-similarity.

This certifies:
1. Self-similarity data implies the golden-ratio fixed-point equation
2. The fixed-point equation uniquely determines φ among positive reals
3. Therefore, any self-similar structure has φ as its preferred scale
