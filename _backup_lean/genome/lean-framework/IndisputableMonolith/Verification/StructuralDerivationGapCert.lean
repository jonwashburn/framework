# Structural Derivation Gap Certificate

This certificate explicitly documents the gap between:
1. **Current state**: Ledger/Bridge are minimal placeholders
2. **Target state**: Ledger/Bridge have rich structure from which observables derive

## The Current Gap

The `Ledger` and `Bridge` structures are currently minimal:

```lean
structure Ledger where
  Carrier : Type
  state : Option Carrier := none
  tick : Option (Carrier → ℕ) := none

structure Bridge (L : Ledger) : Type where
  dummy : Unit := ()
```

There is NO structure from which to derive masses, mixing angles, or g-2.

## What Would Be Needed

To derive observables from structure, we would need:

### For Mass Ratios (from Ledger)
- Ledger with explicit tier structure
- Proof that tier spacing equals φ-power scaling
- `massFromLedgerTiers : RSLedger → List ℝ`

### For Mixing Angles (from Bridge)
- Bridge with CKM-like cycle structure
- Proof that cycle angles equal 1/φ
- `mixingFromBridge : RSBridge → List ℝ`

### For g-2 (from Bridge loops)
- Bridge with loop counting
- Proof that loop contribution equals 1/φ⁵
- `g2FromBridge : RSBridge → ℝ`

## Why This Certificate Exists

This certificate makes the derivation gap EXPLICIT so that:
1. We don't claim "RS derives observables" when we don't
2. Future work has a clear target
3. The certified chain remains honest

3. Future derivation would require richer structure
