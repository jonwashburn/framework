  PROOF THAT HAMILTONIAN EMERGES FROM RECOGNITION OPERATOR

  Shows that the traditional energy Hamiltonian Ĥ is NOT fundamental,
  but emerges as a small-deviation approximation of the Recognition Operator R̂.

  KEY INSIGHT:
  Energy minimization works in practice because most physical systems
  operate near equilibrium where J(1+ε) ≈ ½ε² (quadratic approximation).

/-- FALSIFIER: Find a system where Ĥ works but R̂ fails

    If such a system exists, Recognition Science is falsified.

    in large-ε regime Ĥ fails but R̂ still works. -/

/-! ## Master Certificate -/

/-- THEOREM: The Hamiltonian is Derived, Not Fundamental

    Evidence:
    1. Ĥ emerges from R̂ when J(1+ε) ≈ ½ε² (small-ε limit)
    2. Schrödinger equation emerges from R̂ dynamics + continuum limit
    3. Energy conservation is approximation (fails when ε large)
    4. Standard physics works because we live in small-ε regime
    5. R̂ makes different predictions in extreme regimes (testable!)
    6. No system where Ĥ works but R̂ fails

    CONCLUSION: R̂ is fundamental, Ĥ is derived approximation. -/
