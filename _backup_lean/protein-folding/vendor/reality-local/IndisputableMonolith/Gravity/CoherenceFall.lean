  Formalizes the insight: "Falling is Coherence/Synchronization".

  THE KEY INSIGHT:
  In the presence of a gravitational gradient (varying processing density),
  an extended object experiences a "refresh rate mismatch" (decoherence).

  However, in a frame accelerating at `a`, there is an induced inertial potential
  `Φ_acc(z) = a * z` so that the induced inertial force is `F_inertial = -∇Φ_acc = -a`.

  The "Falling Condition" is the choice of acceleration `a` such that
  the total potential `Φ_total = Φ_grav + Φ_acc` is locally constant (flat).

  Flat potential => Uniform refresh rate => Coherence (Zero J-cost).

  -- If object accelerates down (a < 0), inertial force is up.
  -- Potential Φ_acc such that F = -∇Φ_acc. F_inertial = -a, hence Φ_acc = a * z.

/-- Falling (Acceleration) Restores Coherence.

    Theorem: There exists a unique acceleration `a` that reduces the

    This `a` is exactly the gravitational acceleration `g = -∇Φ`.

/-! ## Interpretation

"Gravity" is the requirement to accelerate in order to maintain
a locally constant processing environment (Coherence).

In this view:
- Standing still (a = 0) in a gravitational field means experiencing a coherence defect
- Free-falling (a = -∇Φ) cancels the defect, restoring coherence
- This is why free fall feels like nothing: you're in the coherent state
