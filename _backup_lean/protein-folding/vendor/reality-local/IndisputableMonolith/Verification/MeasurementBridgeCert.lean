# Measurement Bridge Certificate (C = 2A and weight bridges)

This certificate packages the key **two-branch** measurement bridge theorems proved in
`IndisputableMonolith/Measurement/C2ABridge.lean`:

- `C = 2A` for the canonical path extracted from a two-branch rotation, and
- the corresponding weight identities (pathWeight = exp(-2A), hence Born weight).

It intentionally does **not** import any Quantum scaffolds or `MeasurementAxioms`.
