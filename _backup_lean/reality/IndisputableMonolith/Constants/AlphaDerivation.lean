# Alpha Derivation from First Principles

This module provides a complete, constructive derivation of the fine-structure
constant α⁻¹ from the geometry of the cubic ledger.

## Main Results

1. **Geometric Seed (4π·11)**: Derived from cube edge count minus active edge
2. **Curvature Term (103/102π⁵)**: Derived from voxel seam topology

## The Logic

The Meta-Principle forces a discrete ledger on Z³. The fundamental unit cell is
a cube Q₃. During one atomic tick τ₀, a recognition event traverses ONE edge.
The coupling to the vacuum geometry involves the OTHER edges of the cube.

### Cube Geometry (D = 3)
- Vertices: 2^D = 8
- Edges: D · 2^(D-1) = 3 · 4 = 12
- Faces: 2D = 6

### Active vs Passive
- Active edges per tick: 1 (the transition)
- Passive (field) edges: 12 - 1 = 11

### Crystallographic Closure
- Face count: 6
- Wallpaper groups: 17 (standard crystallographic constant)
- Base normalization: 6 × 17 = 102
- Closure term: +1 (Euler characteristic constraint)
- Seam count: 103
