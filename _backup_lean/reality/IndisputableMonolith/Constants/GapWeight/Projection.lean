# GapWeight.Projection — closing the “weights + normalization” ambiguity

This module defines, explicitly, the two pieces that were historically left implicit:

1) **Why the geometric weights have a `sin²(πk/8)` factor.**
   This is the spectral (eigenvalue) weight induced by the *discrete derivative / Laplacian*
   on the 8-tick cyclic shift. In DFT language, it is forced by shift-diagonalization.

2) **Why the normalization uses a factor of `64`.**
   `64 = 8×8` is the cardinality of the fundamental RS interface cell when we take:
   - 8 ticks (the octave clock), and
   - 8 spatial vertices (the Q₃ cell has 8 vertices).
   The normalization converts a scale-invariant *fraction* into a per-cell integrated weight.

This is claim hygiene: we’re making the operator/measure choice explicit, so there is no
hidden degree of freedom.

## Important note

At present, the pipeline constant `Constants.w8_from_eight_tick` is defined in a closed form
in `Constants/GapWeight.lean` and evaluates to ≈ 2.49056927545.

The operator `w8_projected` above is the *definition-level closure* of what “projection weight”
means: it makes explicit the normalization and the 8×8 measure.

Proving `w8_projected = Constants.w8_from_eight_tick` inside Lean is a tractable (but nontrivial)
algebraic/trigonometric reduction problem and is tracked as a follow-up theorem.
