# Derived Morphology and Radial Factors

This module attempts to derive the `ξ` (morphology) and `n(r)` (radial) factors
from first principles, specifically using the logic of `SevenBeatViolation` and
`ScaleGate` saturation.

## The Problem: HSB Overprediction
As noted in the `ILG_CONVOLUTION_PLAN`, the ILG kernel overpredicts rotation
velocities for High Surface Brightness (HSB) galaxies (baryon-dominated) and
underpredicts for Low Surface Brightness (LSB) galaxies (DM-dominated).

This implies a **suppression mechanism** is needed at high acceleration/surface density,
where the ILG effect should turn off (recovering Newtonian behavior).

## Hypothesis: Seven-Beat Leakage Saturation
The `SevenBeatViolation` module establishes that an 8-beat cycle is the minimal
valid period for D=3. A 7-beat cycle fails neutrality and completeness.

At high energy densities (high acceleration), the "stiffness" of the 8-beat
lock might be overcome by "leakage" into 7-beat modes (or other non-power-of-2 modes).
If these modes cannot carry the ILG "meaning" (force modification), the effective
coupling `ξ` drops.

We quantify this via a "Saturation Scale" related to the gap between 8-beat and 7-beat modes.

/-! ## 1. The Seven-Beat Gap -/

/-- The relative "mode gap" between the valid 8-beat cycle and the invalid 7-beat cycle.
    8-beat has 7 active modes (plus DC).
    7-beat has 6 degrees of freedom (neutrality constraint on 7 slots).
    Relative gap = (7 - 6) / 8 = 1/8.
    Alternatively, using `p_steepness` logic: 1 - 1/8.
    Let's use the inverse gap as a stiffness factor. -/
def seven_beat_gap : ℝ := 1 / 8

/-- The stiffness of the 8-beat lock against 7-beat leakage.
    Stiffness = 1 / Gap = 8. -/
def lock_stiffness : ℝ := 1 / seven_beat_gap

/-! ## 2. Saturation Acceleration Scale -/

/-- The acceleration scale where "saturation" (leakage) begins.
    Hypothesis: The critical acceleration `a_sat` is the characteristic scale `a0`
    boosted by the stiffness of the 8-beat lock.

    a_sat = stiffness * a0 = 8 * a0.

    Physical intuition: You need 8x the characteristic acceleration to "break"
    the 8-beat coherence and suppress the ILG effect. -/
def a_saturation (a0 : ℝ) : ℝ := lock_stiffness * a0

/-! ## 3. Derived Suppression Factor ξ -/

/-- The HSB suppression factor ξ(g).
    This factor multiplies the ILG kernel amplitude.

    Behavior:
    - Low g (<< a_sat): ξ ≈ 1 (Full ILG effect)
    - High g (>> a_sat): ξ -> 0 (Newtonian recovery)

    Functional form: Standard saturation `1 / (1 + x)`.
    Argument x: `g / a_sat`.

    Formula: ξ(g) = 1 / (1 + g / (8*a0))

    This provides the necessary suppression for HSB galaxies (where g is high)
    while maintaining the ILG boost for LSB galaxies (where g is low). -/
def xi_derived (g_baryon : ℝ) (a0 : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  1 / (1 + g_baryon / (a_saturation a0))

/-! ## 4. Radial Profile n(r) -/

/-- The radial profile `n(r)` was calibrated to increase at large radii.
    From a derived perspective, this is likely the inverse of the suppression.

    As r increases, acceleration g drops.
    So ξ(g) increases towards 1.

    If `n(r)` is meant to provide *extra* boost at very low density (LSB underprediction),
    it might be a "Resonance" term that kicks in when `g < a0`.

    Hypothesis: `n(r)` is related to the `ScaleGate` threshold `λ_rec`.
    If density drops near `λ_rec`, maybe we get critical opalescence (enhancement)?

    For now, we define `n_derived` as unity, assuming `xi_derived` handles the
    main systematic bias (HSB overprediction). The LSB underprediction might
    require tuning `a0` or `C` rather than a separate `n(r)`. -/
def n_derived : ℝ := 1

/-! ## 5. Theoretical Bounds -/

/-- Theorem: HSB Suppression recovers Newtonian limit.
    As baryon acceleration goes to infinity, the ILG modification vanishes. -/
