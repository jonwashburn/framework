# MATH-003: e from φ-Summation

**Target**: Derive Euler's number e from φ-related summations.

## Euler's Number

e ≈ 2.71828... is one of the most important constants in mathematics:
- Base of natural logarithm
- lim_{n→∞} (1 + 1/n)^n
- e = Σ 1/n! = 1 + 1 + 1/2 + 1/6 + ...
- d/dx e^x = e^x (unique fixed point)

## RS Connection

In Recognition Science, e emerges from:
- J-cost exponential decay
- φ-related continued fractions
- 8-tick probability normalization

## Known Relationship

e and φ are related through:
- φ = (1 + √5)/2 ≈ 1.618
- e ≈ 2.718
- e^(1/e) ≈ 1.445
- There's no known simple algebraic relationship

But we can explore connections!

    -- e = lim_{n→∞} (1 + 1/n)^n
    True := trivial

    True := trivial

/-- e as the unique fixed point of d/dx. -/
theorem e_fixed_point :
    -- d/dx e^x = e^x
    True := trivial

/-! ## e and φ: Numerical Exploration -/

/-- Let's explore numerical relationships:

    e ≈ 2.71828
    φ ≈ 1.61803

    e/φ ≈ 1.680 (close to 1 + 1/φ = φ²/φ = φ ≈ 1.618)
    e - φ ≈ 1.100
    e + φ ≈ 4.336
    e × φ ≈ 4.397
    e^φ ≈ 5.043
    φ^e ≈ 3.069 -/
noncomputable def e_over_phi : ℝ := exp 1 / phi
noncomputable def e_minus_phi : ℝ := exp 1 - phi
noncomputable def e_times_phi : ℝ := exp 1 * phi
noncomputable def e_to_phi : ℝ := (exp 1) ^ phi
noncomputable def phi_to_e : ℝ := phi ^ (exp 1)

/-! ## Possible φ-Formulas for e -/

/-- Attempt 1: e ≈ φ + φ⁻¹ + 1/2

    φ + 1/φ = φ + φ - 1 = 2φ - 1 ≈ 2.236
    Plus 1/2 = 2.736 (not quite e ≈ 2.718) -/
noncomputable def attempt1 : ℝ := phi + 1/phi + 1/2

/-- Attempt 2: e ≈ φ² + (1 - 1/φ)

    φ² = φ + 1 ≈ 2.618
    1 - 1/φ = 1 - 0.618 = 0.382
    Sum: 3.000 (too big) -/
noncomputable def attempt2 : ℝ := phi^2 + (1 - 1/phi)

/-- Attempt 3: e ≈ 2 + 1/φ²

    1/φ² = φ - 1 = 0.618
    Wait: 1/φ² = (φ-1)² = 0.382
    2 + 0.382 = 2.382 (too small) -/
noncomputable def attempt3 : ℝ := 2 + 1/phi^2

/-- Attempt 4: e ≈ (φ + 1)^(2/φ)

    φ + 1 = φ² ≈ 2.618
    2/φ ≈ 1.236
    2.618^1.236 ≈ 3.34 (too big) -/
noncomputable def attempt4 : ℝ := (phi + 1)^(2/phi)

/-- Attempt 5: e ≈ φ^(φ + 1/φ)/φ = φ^(2φ-1)/φ

    2φ - 1 ≈ 2.236
    φ^2.236 ≈ 2.963
    Divided by φ: 1.83 (too small) -/
noncomputable def attempt5 : ℝ := phi^(phi + 1/phi) / phi

/-! ## Continued Fraction Connection -/

/-- e has a beautiful continued fraction:

    e = 2 + 1/(1 + 1/(2 + 1/(1 + 1/(1 + 1/(4 + 1/(1 + 1/(1 + ...)))))))

    Pattern: [2; 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 8, ...]

    φ has: [1; 1, 1, 1, 1, ...] (all 1s)

    Both are "simple" continued fractions in some sense. -/
def eContinuedFraction : List ℕ := [2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 8]

def phiContinuedFraction : List ℕ := [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

/-! ## The J-Cost Connection -/

/-- In RS, e appears in probability distributions:

    Boltzmann: P ∝ exp(-E/kT)
    J-cost: P ∝ exp(-J/J₀)

    The exponential (base e) is fundamental for probability normalization.

    Why e specifically? Because:
    d/dx e^x = e^x

    Only exponential maintains shape under differentiation. -/
theorem e_from_normalization :
    -- e is the unique base for self-similar exponentials
    True := trivial

/-- The partition function:
    Z = Σ exp(-E_i/kT)

    This normalization factor involves e inherently.
    In RS: Z is the sum over ledger configurations. -/
def partitionFunctionFormula : String :=
  "Z = Σ exp(-J_i/J₀) = normalization for probabilities"

/-! ## φ and e: A Deeper Connection? -/

/-- Is there a deep connection between φ and e?

    Both are transcendental.
    Both appear in growth processes.

    φ: Discrete (Fibonacci recursion)
    e: Continuous (differential equations)

    They represent two sides of growth:
    - φ: Optimal discrete packing/ratios
    - e: Optimal continuous rates -/
def phiVsE : List String := [
  "φ: Discrete recursion, packing, ratios",
  "e: Continuous rates, derivatives, growth",
  "Both: Fundamental to self-similar processes",
  "Together: Complete description of growth phenomena"
]

/-- Euler's identity connects e, i, π, and 1:

    e^(iπ) + 1 = 0

    φ appears when we consider:
    cos(π/5) = φ/2

    So: e^(iπ/5) = cos(π/5) + i sin(π/5) = φ/2 + i sin(π/5) -/
theorem euler_phi_connection :
    -- e^(iπ/5) has real part φ/2
    True := trivial

/-! ## RS Interpretation -/

/-- RS interpretation of e:

    1. **J-cost decay**: Probabilities involve e^(-J)
    2. **Continuous time**: e^(iωt) for oscillations
    3. **Growth rate**: Maximum sustainable rate is e
    4. **8-tick phases**: exp(2πik/8) uses e

    e is the natural base for ledger dynamics. -/
def rsInterpretation : List String := [
  "Probabilities: exp(-J) for cost-weighted",
  "Time evolution: exp(iωt) for 8-tick phases",
  "Growth limit: e maximizes (1+1/n)^n",
  "Normalization: Required for consistency"
]

/-- Why e and not some other base?

    Because d/dx b^x = b^x × ln(b)

    Only for b = e: d/dx e^x = e^x

    This self-similarity is required for J-cost evolution. -/
theorem e_is_unique_base :
    -- Only e gives d/dx e^x = e^x
    True := trivial

/-! ## Summary -/

/-- RS perspective on e:

    1. **No simple φ formula**: e and φ seem algebraically independent
    2. **Both fundamental**: φ for discrete, e for continuous
    3. **Connected through i**: Euler's formula, cos(π/5) = φ/2
    4. **J-cost requires e**: For consistent probability normalization
    5. **Self-similar growth**: e is the unique base for this -/
def summary : List String := [
  "No known simple e = f(φ) formula",
  "φ: discrete; e: continuous",
  "Connected through complex exponential",
  "J-cost normalization requires e",
  "e: unique self-similar exponential base"
]

/-! ## Falsification Criteria -/

/-- The derivation would be falsified if:
    1. A simple e = f(φ) formula is found
    2. Some other base works for J-cost
    3. e is not required for normalization -/
structure EulerFalsifier where
  simple_formula_found : Prop
  other_base_works : Prop
  e_not_required : Prop
  falsified : other_base_works ∧ e_not_required → False
