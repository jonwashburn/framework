# Draft_v1.tex — theorem formalization surface (audit companion)

This module exists to **mirror the theorem statements** appearing in `Draft_v1.tex`
and to map them to what is currently available in this Lean repository.

Where the repo already contains a proved theorem with the same statement, we
re-export it here under a paper-oriented name.

Where the paper relies on heavy external mathematics (e.g. Alexander duality for complements
of embeddings, or full Binet/Bertrand machinery), we provide **explicit hypothesis interfaces**
instead of introducing new global axioms. This keeps the certified surface honest: theorems
depending on those hypotheses are only as strong as the hypotheses supplied.

See also: `Draft_v1_audit.tex` (the LaTeX-side inventory and mapping report).
