# SM-002: Higgs Mechanism from J-Cost Symmetry Breaking

**Target**: Derive spontaneous symmetry breaking and the Higgs mechanism from J-cost structure.

## Core Insight

The Higgs mechanism gives mass to fundamental particles through spontaneous symmetry breaking.
In the Standard Model, the Higgs field has a "Mexican hat" potential with a circle of minima.
The vacuum "chooses" one point on this circle, breaking the symmetry.

In RS, this emerges from the **J-cost functional**:

J(x) = ½(x + 1/x) - 1

The key insight: J(x) has a minimum at x = 1 (the "vacuum"), but the system can be in
a superposition of x and 1/x states. Symmetry breaking occurs when one is selected.

## The J-Cost Potential

The J-cost J(x) = ½(x + 1/x) - 1 has:
- Minimum at x = 1 with J(1) = 0
- Symmetry: J(x) = J(1/x)
- This x ↔ 1/x symmetry is the "gauge symmetry" that gets broken

When the vacuum selects x = φ (the golden ratio), the symmetry is broken,
and particles acquire mass proportional to their J-cost at this point.

## Mass Generation

Particle mass comes from the "recognition cost" of maintaining that particle state.
The Higgs field value determines the energy scale at which this cost manifests.

m ∝ J(field value) × vacuum expectation value
