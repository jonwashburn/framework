# J-Cost Monotonicity and First Derivative Certificate

This certificate packages:
1. The **first derivative formula** for Jcost: d/dx J(x) = (1 - x⁻²)/2
2. The **strict monotonicity** of J on [1, ∞): x < y implies J(x) < J(y)

## Why this matters for the certificate chain

**Gradient information**: The first derivative formula explicitly shows:
- J'(x) = (1 - x⁻²)/2
- J'(1) = 0 (gradient zero at the minimum)
- J'(x) > 0 for x > 1 (increasing on the right)
- J'(x) < 0 for 0 < x < 1 (decreasing on the left)

**Monotonicity**: Combined with the symmetry J(x) = J(1/x), this proves:
- J is strictly decreasing on (0, 1)
- J is strictly increasing on (1, ∞)
- x = 1 is the unique global minimum

**Optimization characterization**: This certifies that cost minimization is well-posed:
the unique minimum at x = 1 is a global minimum with strictly positive curvature.

## Mathematical Content

First derivative formula from J(x) = (x + x⁻¹)/2 - 1:
  d/dx [(x + x⁻¹)/2 - 1] = (1 - x⁻²)/2

Monotonicity proof uses the squared form J(x) = (x-1)²/(2x) and shows:
  f(t) = (t-1)²/t is strictly increasing for t ≥ 1
  via f'(t) = 1 - 1/t² > 0 for t > 1.
