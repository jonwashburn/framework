# Inevitability Structure: The Choke Points

This module formalizes the **inevitability structure** of Recognition Science.

## The Key Insight

Moving from MP-as-foundation to CPM/cost-as-foundation relocates where degrees of freedom live.
It doesn't magically make everything inevitable. What it does is move the "inevitability
bottleneck" from a tautology about `Empty` to a physical claim:

> **Selection happens by minimizing a unique cost.**

## The Three Option Buckets

Under CPM/cost foundation, alternatives organize into three buckets:

**A. Options about the cost itself**
   - Do we get to choose J, or is J forced?
   - Under analyticity + symmetry + convexity + normalization, J is UNIQUE
   - T5: J(x) = ½(x + x⁻¹) - 1

**B. Options about what "exists" means**
   - Existence is not primitive—it's a selection outcome
   - "x exists ⟺ Defect(x) → 0 under coercive projection + aggregation with unique J"

**C. Options about the admissible class of frameworks**
   - "Any zero-parameter framework that derives observables must reduce to RS"
   - Alternatives must break a necessity gate or secretly add parameters

## The Inevitability Theorem

Any alternative theory must violate one of the CPM/cost necessities:

1. **Cost Uniqueness** (T5): J is uniquely determined by symmetry + convexity + normalization
2. **Selection Rule** (CPM): Existence = defect → 0 under coercive projection
3. **Discreteness**: Continuous configs can't stabilize under J
4. **Ledger Structure**: J-symmetry forces double-entry
5. **Self-Similarity**: Discrete ledger + self-similar → φ forced
6. **Dimension**: Linking requirements → D = 3

If all necessities hold → RS is the unique zero-parameter framework.

/-- **THE INEVITABILITY THEOREM**

Any alternative zero-parameter framework that derives observables
must either:
1. Reduce to RS (same cost, same selection, same structure), OR
2. Violate at least one necessity gate

This is the "no alternatives" claim made precise. -/
theorem inevitability (F : AlternativeFramework)

    (F.cost = RS_framework.cost ∧ F.selection = RS_framework.selection) ∨
    (∃ g ∈ all_gates, violates_gate F g) := by
  -- The proof structure:
  -- 1. If F has a different cost, it violates gate_cost_uniqueness (T5)
  -- 2. If F has a different selection rule, it violates gate_selection_rule (CPM)
  -- 3. If F has continuous configs, it violates gate_discreteness
  -- 4. If F has asymmetric recognition, it violates gate_ledger
  -- 5. If F has wrong scale ratio, it violates gate_phi
  -- 6. If F has wrong dimension, it violates gate_dimension
  sorry -- The full proof requires connecting all the forcing modules

/-! ## Summary -/

/-- **INEVITABILITY STRUCTURE SUMMARY**

The CPM/cost foundation provides a clean inevitability story:

1. **Cost is unique** (T5): J(x) = ½(x + x⁻¹) - 1
2. **Selection is coercive**: x exists ⟺ defect(x) → 0
3. **Discreteness is forced**: continuous configs can't stabilize
4. **Ledger is forced**: J-symmetry → double-entry
5. **φ is forced**: self-similar discrete → golden ratio
6. **D = 3 is forced**: linking requirements (scaffold)

Any alternative must violate one of these or add parameters.

The remaining work is closing the scaffolded choke points:
- CPM Universality
- Framework Exclusivity
- Dimension Forcing
