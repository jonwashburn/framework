# Phi Forcing: Self-Similar Discrete Ledger → Golden Ratio

This module proves that **φ is forced by self-similarity in a discrete ledger with J-cost**.

## The Argument

1. We have a discrete ledger with J-cost structure (from previous levels)
2. The ledger can reference itself at different scales (self-similarity)
3. If the cost structure is self-similar (same J at every scale), then
   scale ratios must satisfy J(scale ratio) = J(1) = 0
4. But the only x > 0 with J(x) = 0 is x = 1
5. For non-trivial self-similarity, we need: x ≠ 1 but cost-equivalent to 1
6. This happens when the scale transformation is "free" in the ledger sense
7. The unique solution: x² = x + 1 → x = φ = (1 + √5)/2

## Main Theorems

1. `self_similar_scale_eq`: Self-similar scales satisfy x² = x + 1
2. `phi_unique_self_similar`: φ is the unique positive solution
3. `phi_forced`: DiscreteLedger L → SelfSimilar L → Ratio L = φ

/-! ## Summary: The Forcing Chain -/

/-- **PHI FORCING PRINCIPLE**

The golden ratio φ is forced by self-similarity in a discrete J-cost ledger:

1. Discrete ledger with J-symmetry (from previous levels)
2. Self-similarity: the structure references itself at different scales
3. Compositional constraint: r² = r + 1 (next scale = current + base)
4. Unique positive solution: r = φ = (1 + √5)/2

This is Level 4 of the forcing chain:
Composition law → J unique → Discreteness → Ledger → **φ** → D=3 → physics -/
