# Gap Weight Derivation Certificate

This certificate proves that the DFT-based candidate gap weight and its gap-term
are strictly positive, as required for the α pipeline to subtract a positive gap.

## Key Results

1. **w₈,cand > 0**: the DFT-based candidate weight is positive
2. **f_gap,cand > 0**: the candidate gap term is positive
3. **φ⁸ = 21φ + 13**: Fibonacci identity for φ⁸

## Why This Matters

The gap term appears in the fine-structure constant formula:
  α⁻¹ = 4π·11 - f_gap - δ_κ

For α⁻¹ ≈ 137 to work, we need f_gap > 0 (subtracting a positive amount from
the geometric seed 4π·11 ≈ 138.2). This certificate proves that positivity.

## Mathematical Content

The candidate weight is built from a DFT-8 analysis of the φ-pattern, but it is
**not yet linked** to the certified constant `Constants.w8_from_eight_tick`
used by `Constants.Alpha`.

The proof of positivity shows:
1. All terms in the sum are non-negative (amplitude² × weight)
2. At least one term (k=1) is strictly positive

## Non-Circularity

The proofs use:
- Complex analysis (DFT structure, geometric series)
- Real analysis (phi properties, logarithm positivity)
- No measurement constants, no axioms beyond those in Mathlib
