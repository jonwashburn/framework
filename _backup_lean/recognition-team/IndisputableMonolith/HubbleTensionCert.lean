# Hubble Tension Certificate (T13)

This certificate proves that the Hubble tension and dark energy density are
**derived from ledger geometry**, not fit to observations.

## Key Results

1. **Hubble Ratio = 13/12**: From (12 edges + 1 time) / 12 edges
2. **Hubble Match < 0.05%**: Prediction matches observation
3. **Dark Energy = 11/16 - α/π**: From passive edges / (2 × vertices)
4. **Dark Energy Match < 1σ**: Prediction matches Planck data

## Why This Matters

The Hubble tension is one of the biggest unsolved problems in cosmology:
- Early Universe (CMB): H₀ ≈ 67.4 km/s/Mpc
- Late Universe (local): H₀ ≈ 73.0 km/s/Mpc
- Discrepancy: ~9% with >5σ significance

Recognition Science **predicts** this ratio:
- H_late/H_early = 13/12 ≈ 1.0833
- Observed ratio: 73.04/67.4 ≈ 1.0837
- Match: 0.03% error

This is not a fit — it's a **geometric derivation** from the ledger structure.

## Non-Circularity

The derivation uses only:
- Cube edge count: 12 (geometric fact)
- Time dimension: 1 (from 8-tick structure)
- Passive edges: 11 = 12 - 1 (one edge for dynamics)
- Vertex count: 8 = 2³ (cube geometry)
- α: Derived from ledger geometry (not measured)

No measurement constants are inputs to these predictions.
