/-! ## AM-GM Inequality for Reciprocals -/

/-- The AM-GM inequality for x and 1/x: for all x > 0, x + 1/x ≥ 2.

    This is the fundamental inequality that forces J-cost ≥ 0.

    **Proof**: Use Mathlib's `add_div_two_ge_sqrt_mul_self_of_sq_le_sq` or direct algebra. -/

  have h1 : x * (1/x) = 1 := by field_simp
  have h2 : (x - 1/x)^2 ≥ 0 := sq_nonneg _
  -- (x - 1/x)² = x² - 2 + 1/x²
  -- So x² + 1/x² ≥ 2
  -- We need: x + 1/x ≥ 2
  -- Use: (x + 1/x)² = x² + 2 + 1/x² ≥ 4, so x + 1/x ≥ 2 (since both positive)
  have hx_inv_pos : 1/x > 0 := by positivity
  have h_sum_pos : x + 1/x > 0 := by linarith
  -- Alternative: direct Mathlib lemma
