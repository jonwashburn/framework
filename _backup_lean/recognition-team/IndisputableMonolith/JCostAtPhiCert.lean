# J-Cost at Phi Certificate

This certificate proves that J(φ) > 0, meaning the golden ratio is NOT
at the minimum of the J-cost function.

## Key Result

**J(φ) > 0**: The J-cost at the golden ratio is strictly positive.

## Why this matters for the certificate chain

This result clarifies the role of φ in Recognition Science:

1. **φ is NOT the J-cost minimizer**: The minimum is at x = 1 where J(1) = 0
2. **φ is the RATIO minimizer**: φ emerges from self-similarity constraints
3. **Non-trivial cost**: J(φ) ≈ 0.118 represents the "cost" of golden-ratio scaling

## Mathematical Content

J(φ) = 0.5 × (φ + 1/φ) - 1
     = 0.5 × √5 - 1       (using φ + 1/φ = √5)
     = (√5 - 2)/2
     ≈ 0.118

Since √5 > 2 (because 5 > 4), we have J(φ) > 0.

This shows that φ-scaling has a non-zero information cost, which is
essential for the Recognition Science cost accounting.
