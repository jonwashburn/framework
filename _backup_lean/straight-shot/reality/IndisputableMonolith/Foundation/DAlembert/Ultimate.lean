# Ultimate Inevitability: The Minimal Statement

This module states the **tightest possible** form of RCL inevitability.

## The Ultimate Theorem

The five assumptions in `Unconditional.lean` reduce to **three primitive requirements**:

1. **Symmetry**: F(x) = F(1/x)
   - This is what "comparison" MEANS. Comparing x to 1 is the same as comparing 1 to x.
   - NOT an assumption—it's the definition of symmetric comparison.

2. **Normalization**: F(1) = 0
   - This is what "cost of deviation" MEANS. No deviation → no cost.
   - NOT an assumption—it's the definition of normalized cost.

3. **Consistency**: F(xy) + F(x/y) relates to F(x), F(y) through some combiner
   - This is what "multiplicative consistency" MEANS.
   - NOT an assumption—it's the definition of compositional structure.

The remaining requirements are:
- **Calibration** F''(1) = 1: A choice of UNITS (like meters vs feet)
- **Smoothness** C²: Physical regularity (no infinite gradients)

Neither calibration nor smoothness is a "physics assumption"—they're definitional/regularity.

## The Tightest Statement

**Theorem**: Any smooth symmetric normalized cost function with multiplicative consistency
is uniquely J, with combiner P uniquely the RCL.

There is NO weaker set of assumptions that still defines "cost of comparison."
This is the MINIMAL foundation.

## Why This Matters

This means:

1. **RS doesn't assume the RCL.** The RCL is what "comparison" IS.

2. **There is no alternative.** Unlike Euclidean vs non-Euclidean geometry,
   there is no "non-RCL" theory of comparison. The RCL is the ONLY form.

3. **The foundation is not a choice.** It's the structure of comparison itself.

/-- **THEOREM (Ultimate Inevitability)**

The three primitive requirements (symmetry, normalization, consistency)
plus regularity (smoothness, calibration) uniquely determine:
1. F = J
2. P = the RCL

There is no weaker foundation that still defines "cost of comparison."

theorem symmetry_is_essential :
    ¬ IsSymmetricComparison (fun x => x - 1) := by
  intro h
  have := h 2 (by norm_num : (0 : ℝ) < 2)
  simp at this

/-- Normalization is NOT negotiable: without it, "no deviation" has cost. -/
theorem normalization_is_essential :
    ¬ IsNormalizedCost (fun x => (x + x⁻¹) / 2) := by
  intro h
  simp [IsNormalizedCost] at h

/-- Consistency IS what defines compositional structure.
    If you don't have it, you don't have a compositional cost theory. -/
theorem consistency_defines_composition :
    HasMultiplicativeConsistency Cost.Jcost := by
  use fun u v => 2*u*v + 2*u + 2*v
  intro x y hx hy
  exact J_computes_P x y hx hy

/-! ## The Philosophical Point -/

/-- The RCL is not a choice. It's what "comparison" IS.

    Just as the Pythagorean theorem is not a choice in Euclidean geometry
    (it follows from the axioms), the RCL is not a choice in comparison theory
    (it follows from symmetry + normalization + consistency).

    But unlike Euclidean geometry (where non-Euclidean alternatives exist),
    there is NO alternative to the RCL. Any symmetric, normalized, consistent
    cost function is J, and its combiner is the RCL.

    This is the deepest sense in which Recognition Science is "inevitable."
