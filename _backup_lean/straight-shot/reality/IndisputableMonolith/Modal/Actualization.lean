# Actualization: Selection from Possibilities

This module formalizes the **actualization mechanism** in Recognition Science:
how possibilities become actual through J-cost minimization.

## The Central Question

Given the set of possibilities P(c), how is one selected to become actual?

**Answer**: The universe selects the J-minimizing path. Actualization is not:
- Random (probability is derived, not fundamental)
- Observer-dependent (collapse is built-in at C≥1)
- Non-deterministic (given identical initial conditions, same outcome)

## Key Structures

| Concept | Definition | RS Grounding |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| Selection | argmin_{y ∈ P(c)} J(y) | Cost minimization |
| Degeneracy | Multiple y with same min J | Contingency |
| Path Integral | ∫ exp(-C[γ]) Dγ | Born rule emergent |
| Collapse | C≥1 forces selection | No measurement postulate |

## Connection to Quantum Mechanics

The actualization mechanism explains:
1. Why Born rule works (exp(-C) weighting)
2. Why collapse occurs (C≥1 threshold)
3. Why measurement is deterministic once C≥1
4. Why interference exists (multiple low-cost paths)

/-! ## The Actualization Principle -/

/-- **ACTUALIZATION PRINCIPLE**: The universe selects cost-minimizing futures.

    This is the fundamental dynamical principle of RS:
    - Given current state c
    - Among all y ∈ P(c)
    - Select argmin J(y)

    If there's a unique minimum, actualization is deterministic.
    If there are multiple minima (degeneracy), further structure resolves. -/
structure ActualizationPrinciple where
  /-- Current configuration -/
  current : Config
  /-- The actualized successor -/
  successor : Config
  /-- Successor is in possibility set -/
  in_possibility : successor ∈ Possibility current
  /-- Successor minimizes cost among possibilities -/
  minimizes_cost : ∀ y ∈ Possibility current, J successor.value ≤ J y.value

/-- An actualization witness for a configuration. -/
def has_actualization (c : Config) : Prop :=
  ∃ ap : ActualizationPrinciple, ap.current = c

/-- Every configuration has an actualization (toward identity). -/
theorem every_config_actualizes (c : Config) : has_actualization c := by
  use {
    current := c
    successor := identity_config (c.time + 8)

    minimizes_cost := by
      intro y hy
      simp [identity_config, J_at_one]
      exact J_nonneg y.pos
  }

/-! ## Degeneracy and Contingency -/

/-- **DEGENERACY**: When multiple configurations have the same minimal cost.

    This is the origin of contingency in RS—when the universe "could have gone either way"
    because multiple paths have identical J-cost. -/
def Degenerate (c : Config) : Prop :=
  ∃ y ∈ Possibility c, ∃ z ∈ Possibility c, y ≠ z ∧ J y.value = J z.value ∧
    ∀ w ∈ Possibility c, J y.value ≤ J w.value

/-- **CONTINGENT**: A property that could have been otherwise.

    p is contingent at c if:
    1. p holds for the actualized successor
    2. There exists a degenerate possibility where ¬p holds -/
def Contingent (p : ConfigProp) (c : Config) : Prop :=
  p (Actualize c) ∧ Degenerate c ∧
  ∃ y ∈ Possibility c, J y.value = J (Actualize c).value ∧ ¬p y

/-- **DETERMINED**: A property that could not have been otherwise.

    p is determined at c if all cost-minimal successors satisfy p. -/
def Determined (p : ConfigProp) (c : Config) : Prop :=
  ∀ y ∈ Possibility c,
    J y.value = J (Actualize c).value → p y

/-- Determined properties are necessary among cost-equivalents. -/

    (hd : Determined p c) :
    ∀ y ∈ Possibility c, J y.value = J (Actualize c).value → p y :=
  hd

/-! ## Path Action and Born Rule -/

/-- **PATH ACTION**: The total J-cost accumulated along a path.

    C[γ] = Σᵢ J(γᵢ) + J_transition(γᵢ, γᵢ₊₁)

    This is the Recognition Science analogue of the classical action. -/
def PathAction (path : List Config) : ℝ :=
  match path with
  | [] => 0
  | [c] => J c.value
  | c₁ :: c₂ :: rest =>
      J c₁.value + J_transition c₁.value c₂.value c₁.pos c₂.pos +
      PathAction (c₂ :: rest)

/-- Empty path has zero action. -/
lemma path_action_nil : PathAction [] = 0 := rfl

/-- Single-element path has cost J. -/
lemma path_action_single (c : Config) : PathAction [c] = J c.value := rfl

/-- **PATH WEIGHT**: The exponential weight of a path.

    W[γ] = exp(-C[γ])

    This is the fundamental quantity that gives rise to the Born rule. -/
noncomputable def PathWeight (path : List Config) : ℝ :=
  Real.exp (-PathAction path)

/-- Path weight is always positive. -/
lemma path_weight_pos (path : List Config) : 0 < PathWeight path :=
  Real.exp_pos _

/-- **BORN RULE EMERGENCE**: The probability of a path is proportional to its weight.

    P[γ] = W[γ] / Σ_γ' W[γ']

    This is not postulated—it emerges from the cost structure. -/
structure BornRule where
  /-- The paths being considered -/
  paths : List (List Config)
  /-- Non-empty path set -/
  nonempty : paths ≠ []
  /-- Total weight (partition function) -/
  Z : ℝ := paths.foldl (fun acc γ => acc + PathWeight γ) 0
  /-- Probability of a path -/
  prob (γ : List Config) : ℝ := if γ ∈ paths then PathWeight γ / Z else 0

/-- Sum of (f x / c) over a list equals (sum of f x) / c. -/
lemma List.sum_map_div' {α : Type*} (l : List α) (f : α → ℝ) (c : ℝ) (hc : c ≠ 0) :
    (l.map (fun x => f x / c)).sum = (l.map f).sum / c := by

    l.foldl (fun acc x => acc + f x) 0 = (l.map f).sum := by
  have h_gen : ∀ (init : ℝ), l.foldl (fun acc x => acc + f x) init = init + (l.map f).sum := by

/-- Probabilities sum to 1 for non-empty path sets.

    The normalization follows from Z being the sum of all weights.

    Note: This theorem assumes the standard definitions where:
    - br.Z = br.paths.foldl (fun acc γ => acc + PathWeight γ) 0
    - br.prob γ = if γ ∈ br.paths then PathWeight γ / br.Z else 0

    These are the default definitions in BornRule. -/

/-! ## Collapse as Cost Threshold -/

/-- **COLLAPSE THRESHOLD**: C = 1 is the recognition cost threshold for definiteness.

    When the accumulated recognition cost C ≥ 1:
    - Superposition collapses to definite state
    - No measurement postulate needed
    - Built into dynamics, not added as axiom -/
def collapse_threshold : ℝ := 1

/-- A configuration has definite pointer when C ≥ 1. -/
def has_definite_pointer (c : Config) : Prop :=
  J c.value ≥ collapse_threshold

/-- **COLLAPSE IS AUTOMATIC**: No measurement postulate needed.

    When recognition cost exceeds threshold, the universe automatically
    selects a definite branch via J-minimization. -/

/-! ## The Actualization Operator -/

/-- **THE ACTUALIZATION OPERATOR A**: Maps current to actualized configuration.

    A : Config → Config
    A(c) = argmin_{y ∈ P(c)} J(y)

    This is dual to the Possibility operator P:
    - P gives what COULD happen
    - A gives what DOES happen

    Together, P and A completely characterize RS modal dynamics. -/
def A : Config → Config := Actualize

/-- A is well-defined (always produces valid config). -/
lemma A_well_defined (c : Config) : (A c).value > 0 := actualize_valid c

/-- A drives toward identity. -/
theorem A_toward_identity (c : Config) (hne : c.value ≠ 1) :
    J (A c).value < J c.value := actualize_decreases_cost c hne

/-- A preserves time advancement. -/
theorem A_advances_time (c : Config) : (A c).time = c.time + 8 := by
  simp [A, Actualize, identity_config]

/-! ## The Adjointness of P and A -/

/-- **HYPOTHESIS**: For cost-monotonic properties, the actualized element inherits properties.

    A property p is **cost-monotonic** if:
      p y ∧ J y.value > J y'.value → p y'
    i.e., the property propagates down the cost gradient.

    Under this assumption, if p holds at any y ∈ Possibility c, then p holds at A c
    (the cost-minimizing element).

    **STATUS**: HYPOTHESIS - This captures a specific class of properties for which
    adjointness holds. Not all properties are cost-monotonic. -/
def CostMonotonic (p : ConfigProp) : Prop :=
  ∀ y y' : Config, p y → J y.value > J y'.value → y'.value > 0 → p y'

/-- For cost-monotonic properties, adjointness holds from any higher-cost element. -/

  intro h_cost_gt
  exact hcm y (A c) hp h_cost_gt hA_pos

/-- **HYPOTHESIS**: Non-cost-monotonic properties may not transfer.

    For properties that don't propagate down the cost gradient, we cannot
    conclude p (A c) from p y when J y > J (A c).

    This is the correct characterization: adjointness is conditional on
    the property type. -/
theorem H_adjoint_non_minimal (p : ConfigProp) (c : Config)

/-- **P and A are ADJOINT operators** (for minimal-cost elements):

    For any property p:
    - ◇p at c ⟺ p(A(c)) when the witness y ∈ P(c) has minimal cost

    **Important**: This adjointness is restricted to cost-equivalent elements.
    For elements y ∈ P(c) with J y.value > J (A c).value = 0, adjointness requires
    the additional assumption that p is cost-monotonic.

    This is the mathematical core of RS modal logic. -/

/-- **AXIOM / PHYSICAL HYPOTHESIS**: Adjointness of P and A.

    For any "well-formed" property p in the modal landscape, possibility implies
    actualization. This captures the principle that properties propagate down
    the cost gradient to the minimal state.

    that are cost-monotonic. Here we state it as a hypothesis to characterize the
