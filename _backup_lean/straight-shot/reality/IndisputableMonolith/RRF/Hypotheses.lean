# RRF Hypotheses

Umbrella file for RRF explicit hypotheses.

These are PHYSICAL CLAIMS, not definitional truths or proven theorems.
Each hypothesis:
1. Makes specific predictions
2. Has explicit falsification criteria
3. Is isolated from Core (never imported by Core)

## Contents

- `PhiLadder`: The φ-scaling hypothesis
- `EightTick`: The 8-phase discretization hypothesis
- `TauGate`: The tau lepton / biological gate correspondence

## RRF Hypotheses Status

Hypotheses are explicit and falsifiable. They are NOT imported by Core,
ensuring the core definitions remain hypothesis-agnostic.
