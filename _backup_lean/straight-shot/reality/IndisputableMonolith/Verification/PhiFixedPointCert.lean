# Phi Fixed Point Certificate

This certificate proves that `Constants.phi = 1 + 1 / Constants.phi`, i.e., φ = 1 + 1/φ.

## Key Result

`Constants.phi = 1 + 1 / Constants.phi`

## Why this matters for the certificate chain

This is the **fixed-point equation** for the golden ratio:

1. **Defining property**: φ² = φ + 1
2. **Fixed-point form**: φ = 1 + 1/φ
3. **Iterative meaning**: φ is the unique positive fixed point of f(x) = 1 + 1/x

This property is fundamental to Recognition Science because:
- It shows φ as a self-referential solution
- The iteration x_{n+1} = 1 + 1/x_n converges to φ
- It connects φ to continued fractions: φ = 1 + 1/(1 + 1/(1 + ...))

## Mathematical Content

From φ² = φ + 1, dividing by φ (using φ ≠ 0):
```
φ² / φ = (φ + 1) / φ
φ = φ/φ + 1/φ
φ = 1 + 1/φ
```

This is the classical fixed-point representation of the golden ratio.

## Physical Significance

The fixed-point equation expresses φ's **self-similarity**:
- φ contains its own reciprocal in its definition
- This mirrors the self-referential nature of Recognition
- The "part contains the whole" structure of the ledger

In Recognition Science:
- The ledger's self-balancing uses this fixed-point property
- Cost minimization at φ reflects this self-similarity
- The 8-tick structure inherits φ's self-referential nature

## Relationship to Other Properties

This fixed-point equation requires:
- `phi_ne_zero` (#110): φ ≠ 0 (division is defined)
- `phi_squared` (#12): φ² = φ + 1 (the defining equation)

And implies:
- φ > 1 (since 1/φ > 0)
- φ is irrational (continued fraction is infinite)
