Predefine dose/power accounting, temperature monitoring, and blinding. \newline controls: Sham stimulation; off-rung controls n-0.5 and n+0.5 from Table~\ref{tab:paper1\_jamming\_targets}; thermal-control condition with matched bulk heating; randomized-frequency control within declared band excluding targets. & Primary falsifier: no statistically significant difference vs sham and off-rung controls under preregistered effect-size threshold (e.g. >=10% shift in median folding time or >=0.2 SD change) with multiple-comparisons correction; or observed effects fully explained by measured temperature rise / denaturation. \\\nbiophase\_tau\_gate\_protocol & protocol & 19 & tau\_gate\_extraction & 65 ps & Time-resolved IR spectroscopy near 724 cm$^{-1}$; define X(t) from a preregistered band window and extract tau\_gate as the 1/e decay of the autocorrelation envelope; see docs/paper1\_biophase\_gate\_protocol.md. \newline controls: Off-band windows; time-shuffle control; sham/thermal control for any stimulation condition. & Falsifier: no stable tau\_gate fit above instrument-response floor, or tau\_gate indistinguishable from off-band controls, or non-reproducible across preregistered replications/analysts. \\\n\bottomrule\n\end{longtable}\n
