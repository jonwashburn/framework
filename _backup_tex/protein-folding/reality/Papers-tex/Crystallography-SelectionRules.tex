\title{Crystallography Selection Rules from Eight-Window Neutrality and Legal Triads}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We propose selection rules for reciprocal-space motifs based on (i) an
eight-window neutrality diagnostic and (ii) a legal-triad parity constraint.
We test for empirical bias in space-group frequencies without tuned parameters.
\end{abstract}

\section{Rules}
Legal triad (proxy): parity of $h{+}k{+}l$ is even and $(h,k,l)\neq(0,0,0)$.
Neutrality: aligned eight-step window sum vanishes for motif weights.

\section{Falsifier}
If corrected space-group frequencies do not overweight families predicted by
the rules (relative to baseline motif counts), the selection hypothesis fails.
