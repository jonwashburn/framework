\section*{Field}
This disclosure relates to quantum information devices and control, and more particularly to methods, apparatus, and control software that suppress spurious measurement/decoherence channels by using geometry and temporal phase gating derived from an intrinsic recognition threshold.

\section*{Background}
Quantum devices are sensitive to unintended couplings that act as partial measurements, degrading coherence and causing crosstalk. Existing mitigation includes shielding, filtering, detuning, and time-multiplexing, but lacks a principled angular threshold for when recognition (measurement-like extraction) is feasible at a given interaction budget.

\section*{Summary}
We disclose a threshold-based operating doctrine for quantum devices. Let the kernel-level action versus sensor angle be $\Aof{\theta}=-\ln(\sin\theta)$ for $\theta\in(0,\tfrac{\pi}{2}]$. For a finite action budget $A_{\max}>0$, define the minimal admissible angle
\[ \thetam(A_{\max}) := \arcsin\big(e^{-A_{\max}}\big). \]
Channels with effective recognition angle $\theta<\thetam$ are infeasible at the given budget and are therefore suppressed; channels with $\theta\ge\thetam$ are feasible. Devices are operated such that (i) non-target couplings remain sub-threshold (idle geometry), (ii) target readout/control transitions are made supra-threshold \emph{only within} permitted phase windows of a discrete cadence (phase gating), and (iii) the effective budget is reduced during idle and raised locally for readout.

\section*{Brief Description of the Drawings}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Fig. 1 illustrates a spherical-cap blind cone of half-angle $\thetam$ about a collinear axis (non-target directions), marking infeasible directions at a given budget.
  \item Fig. 2 shows $A(\theta)=-\ln(\sin\theta)$ and threshold markers $\theta=\thetam(A_{\max})$ for several budgets.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Detailed Description of Embodiments}
\paragraph{Threshold and gating.} For a device channel with effective sensor angle $\theta$, the recognition weight scales as $w=\exp(-2\Aof{\theta})=(\sin\theta)^2$ in the kernel-dominated regime. For a given $A_{\max}$, the device is configured so that non-target channels satisfy $\theta<\thetam(A_{\max})$ during idle, while the intended detector/coupler is actuated to $\theta\ge\thetam(A_{\max})$ only within designated phase windows of a discrete cadence (e.g., eight-tick). Budget steering (filters, attenuation, detuning, shielding) increases $\thetam$ during idle and reduces it locally during readout.

\paragraph{Superconducting embodiment.} A transmon or cavity device with adjustable readout/feedline coupler orientation relative to a mode axis. Packaging and coupler pads are oriented so parasitic couplings to non-target modes have $\theta<\thetam$ in idle. A controller actuates tunable couplers or switches to achieve $\theta\ge\thetam$ in permitted windows for readout.

\paragraph{Trapped-ion embodiment.} Raman/readout beams are incident at angles engineered so spectator ions see sub-threshold angles; gate/readout beams are phase-gated and steered to supra-threshold angles for the targeted ion only within windows.

\paragraph{Integrated photonics embodiment.} Directional couplers and polarization elements are oriented so non-target ports see sub-threshold angles. Readout ports are brought above threshold during windows by thermo-optic or electro-optic tuning.

\paragraph{Controller/scheduler.} A timing controller maintains a window set and phases operations to those windows, while tracking budget state and geometry state to satisfy the feasibility predicate (angle and time). The controller can auto-calibrate by measuring spurious recognition vs.~$\theta$ and adjusting toward sub-threshold during idle.

  \item A non-transitory computer-readable medium storing instructions that, when executed by a controller, cause the controller to: (i) determine $\thetam=\arcsin(e^{-A_{\max}})$ from a budget parameter; (ii) maintain geometry states with $\theta<\thetam$ for non-target couplings; and (iii) schedule operations so that $\theta\ge\thetam$ only within permitted phase windows.

\section*{Abstract}
Methods, apparatus, systems, and software for suppressing parasitic recognition in quantum devices by enforcing a budget-dependent angular threshold $\thetam=\arcsin(e^{-A_{\max}})$ and discrete phase gating. Non-target couplings are kept sub-threshold during idle; target couplings are raised above threshold only within permitted phase windows. The approach reduces spurious measurement and crosstalk across superconducting, trapped-ion, and photonic platforms with low overhead and is compatible with quantum error correction.
