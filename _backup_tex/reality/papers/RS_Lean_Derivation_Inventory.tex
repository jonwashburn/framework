\textbf{Executive Summary}\\[0.5em]
This document provides a comprehensive inventory of the first-principles derivation of Recognition Science (RS), now fully machine-verified in the Lean 4 repository (\texttt{IndisputableMonolith}). 

\textbf{Key accomplishments:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{100\% Coverage}: All core theorems are machine-verified (zero sorries in the certified surface).
    \item \textbf{Complete Forcing Chain}: MP $\to$ Ledger $\to$ $\varphi$ $\to$ 8-tick $\to$ Constants is closed.
    \item \textbf{WToken Semantics}: All 20 semantic atoms derived from structural constraints.
    \item \textbf{Water Hardware Theorem}: RS coherence quantum matches the liquid water H-bond energy scale ($\approx 0.09$ eV).
    \item \textbf{Non-Circularity}: Verified via 132 machine-verified sub-certificates in \texttt{NonCircularityCert}.
