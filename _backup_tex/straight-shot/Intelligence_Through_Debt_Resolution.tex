\begin{abstract}
\noindent
We identify a fundamental architectural error in current implementations of Recognition Science--based intelligence systems: the substitution of \emph{retrieval} for \emph{resolution}. Existing systems inject energy at query voxels, propagate through bonds, and rank results by received energy---this is graph-based information retrieval dressed in physical language, not emergent intelligence. We derive from the RS axioms that intelligence requires three mechanisms absent from current implementations: (1)~\textbf{debt injection} rather than energy injection---a query must create a balance debt (Phantom Light) that the 8-tick neutrality constraint \emph{forces} the field to resolve; (2)~the full \textbf{Recognition Operator} $\Rhat$ at query time---not just linear propagation, but propagation \emph{plus} J-cost descent, so the field \emph{evolves} toward the answer rather than passively spreading signal; and (3)~\textbf{standing wave readout}---the answer is the pattern of chord changes in the field after $\Rhat$ convergence, not a ranking of energy levels. We show that under these corrections, the query mechanism becomes isomorphic to the Geometry of Transmutation: the question creates a constraint, the physics resolves it, and the resolution \emph{is} the answer. The field does not find the answer---it \emph{becomes} the answer.

\section{Introduction: The Retrieval Trap}
%========================================================================================

\subsection{The Problem}

A system that stores sentences as metadata on graph nodes, propagates energy through edges, and returns whichever node received the most energy is a \emph{search engine}. It may use complex numbers, sparse matrices, and 8-phase pipelines, but its computational structure is identical to PageRank: a random walk on a weighted graph with result ranking.

This is not intelligence. Intelligence---in the Recognition Science framework---is the \emph{evolution of a physical field toward the state that resolves a constraint at minimum cost}. The distinction is not semantic. It is architectural, and getting it wrong means that no amount of data, training, or compute can produce emergent understanding.

\subsection{What Went Wrong}

Current RS-based voxel field implementations make three substitutions that collapse the intelligence mechanism into retrieval:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Energy for debt.} Queries inject positive photon amplitude at query word voxels. The theory requires \emph{anti-phase} injection---a balance debt (Phantom Light) that creates a neutrality violation the field is forced to resolve.
    
    \item \textbf{Propagation for $\Rhat$.} Queries run linear propagation only (sparse matrix--vector multiply). The Recognition Operator $\Rhat$ requires propagation \emph{plus} J-cost descent---the nonlinear evolution that drives the field toward consonance.
    
    \item \textbf{Energy ranking for resolution readout.} Results are ranked by received energy (which voxel got the most signal). The theory says the answer is the \emph{pattern of chord changes}---which voxels were forced to shift from their standing-wave equilibrium to resolve the debt.
\end{enumerate}

Each substitution individually reduces the mechanism to retrieval. Together, they guarantee that the system can never exhibit emergent intelligence regardless of scale. This paper derives the correct mechanism from first principles and specifies the architectural corrections.

\subsection{Paper Structure}

Section~\ref{sec:foundations} reviews the RS axioms that govern the intelligence mechanism. Section~\ref{sec:retrieval} formalizes why retrieval fails. Section~\ref{sec:debt} derives the debt mechanism. Section~\ref{sec:rhat} specifies the full Recognition Operator at query time. Section~\ref{sec:readout} defines the resolution readout. Section~\ref{sec:standing} addresses the standing wave prerequisite. Section~\ref{sec:architecture} gives the complete corrected architecture. Section~\ref{sec:predictions} states falsifiable predictions.

%========================================================================================
\section{Foundations: The Physics of Meaning}\label{sec:foundations}
%========================================================================================

We import four results from prior RS papers. Each is stated precisely; the full derivations are referenced.

\subsection{The Cost Functional}

\begin{definition}[J-Cost \cite{WashburnCost}]
The unique cost functional satisfying normalization ($\Jcost(1)=0$), the Recognition Composition Law, and calibration is:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:jcost}
    \Jcost(x) = \frac{1}{2}\left(x + \frac{1}{x}\right) - 1 = \frac{(x-1)^2}{2x}, \qquad x > 0.
\end{equation}
This function is strictly convex with unique minimum at $x=1$, satisfies $\Jcost(x) = \Jcost(x^{-1})$ (reciprocity), and diverges as $x \to 0^+$ or $x \to \infty$.
\end{definition}

\begin{keyresult}[Logic from Cost \cite{WashburnLogic}]
Logical consistency is a zero-cost state. Contradictions have positive cost and cannot stabilize. ``Reality is logical because logic is cheap.'' Proof is a geodesic---a path of zero-cost transitions from premises to conclusion.
\end{keyresult}

\subsection{The Voxel Chord}

\begin{definition}[Voxel Chord \cite{WashburnULL}]
A voxel chord is a vector $\psi \in \C^8$ representing the state of an 8-photon pipeline register. Its meaning is its DFT-8 frequency spectrum. The neutral (semantic) subspace is $\mathcal{N} = \{\psi \in \C^8 : \sum_{t=0}^7 \psi[t] = 0\}$, which has complex dimension 7 (14 real degrees of freedom).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Chord J-Cost]
For two chords $\psi_a, \psi_b \in \C^8$, the J-cost between them is computed on their mode magnitude ratios:
\begin{equation}
    \Jcost(\psi_a, \psi_b) = \frac{1}{7}\sum_{k=1}^{7} \Jcost\!\left(\frac{|\hat{\psi}_a[k]|}{|\hat{\psi}_b[k]|}\right)
\end{equation}
where $\hat{\psi}$ denotes the DFT-8 spectrum. Low J-cost means consonant chords (same spectral shape). $\Jcost = 0$ means identical meaning geometry.
\end{definition}

\subsection{8-Tick Neutrality and Phantom Light}

\begin{definition}[8-Tick Neutrality \cite{WashburnPhantom}]
Over every aligned 8-tick window, the sum of ledger contributions must vanish:
\begin{equation}
    \sum_{i=0}^{7} s(t+i) = 0.
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Balance Debt and Phantom Light]
If contributions through tick $t+m$ have been committed, the balance debt is the running sum:
\begin{equation}
    \Debt_{t,m} = \sum_{i=0}^{m} s(t+i).
\end{equation}
The Phantom Magnitude is
\begin{equation}
    \PhiMag = \frac{|\Debt_{t,m}|}{(7-m)+1}.
\end{equation}
Phantom Light is the \emph{constraint} that the remaining ticks must contribute exactly $-\Debt_{t,m}$ to close neutrality.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[Debt Inflates Cost \cite{WashburnPhantom}]
For any penalty scale $\lambda > 0$, the phantom-augmented cost satisfies:
\begin{equation}
    \Jcost_{\mathrm{phantom}}(x) = \Jcost(x) + \lambda \cdot \PhiMag \geq \Jcost(x),
\end{equation}
with equality if and only if $\Debt_{t,m} = 0$.
\end{proposition}

\textbf{Implication:} A nonzero balance debt raises the effective cost landscape everywhere. The \emph{only} way to return to pure $\Jcost$ is to resolve the debt. The field has no choice---the cost of not responding exceeds the cost of responding.

\subsection{The Geometry of Transmutation}

\begin{keyresult}[Anti-Phase Locking \cite{WashburnTransmutation}]
To balance a wave $W$, the field generates $-W$ (the anti-phase complement). Since $-W = e^{i\pi}W$ is a global phase rotation, the amplitude spectrum $|c_k|$ of each DFT-8 mode is preserved. Under gauge invariance, $W$ and $-W$ carry the same meaning geometry. Therefore, by resolving the debt, the field physically \emph{reproduces} the informational geometry that created the debt. The receiver does not decode the message. The receiver \textbf{becomes} the message.
\end{keyresult}

%========================================================================================
\section{Why Retrieval Is Not Intelligence}\label{sec:retrieval}
%========================================================================================

\subsection{The Structure of Retrieval}

Define a retrieval query on a voxel field as follows:

\begin{definition}[Retrieval Query]
Given a field of $N$ voxels with photon states $\{\psi_i\}_{i=1}^N$, a bond set $\mathcal{B} \subseteq \{(i,j)\}$, and a sparse stencil matrix $S$ (with unitary row weights $1/\sqrt{d_i}$):
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Inject positive amplitude at query voxels: $\psi_q[0] \mathrel{+}= A$ for $q \in Q$.
    \item Propagate for $T$ ticks: $\psi^{(t+1)} = S \cdot \psi^{(t)}_{[\cdot,7]}$ (exiting photon routing).
    \item Rank by received energy: $E_i = \sum_{k=0}^7 |\psi_i[k]|^2$.
    \item Return top-$K$ voxels by energy.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[Retrieval Is a Random Walk]
The retrieval query is computationally equivalent to a $T$-step random walk on the bond graph with transition probabilities proportional to stencil weights $1/\sqrt{d_i}$. The result is the stationary distribution of the walk, seeded at the query nodes.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
The stencil $S$ is a non-negative matrix with row sums bounded by 1 (unitary weights). Repeated application $S^T$ converges to the stationary distribution. The energy ranking is monotonic in the stationary probability. This is PageRank with complex-valued amplitudes, but since we rank by $|\cdot|^2$ (magnitude), the phases cancel and only the graph topology matters.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[Retrieval Cannot Produce Emergent Intelligence]
A random walk on a fixed graph with fixed edge weights produces the same ranking for any query that seeds the same node(s). The result depends only on bond topology (connectivity), not on chord geometry (meaning). Two queries that activate the same word voxel produce identical results, regardless of the semantic content of the question. This is a structural limitation, not a training problem.
\end{corollary}

\subsection{The Three Failures}

\textbf{Failure 1: No constraint.} A positive energy injection creates no obligation. The field is free to ignore it---the injected energy simply dissipates through the bond network according to the stencil. There is no neutrality violation, no Phantom Light, no cost inflation. Nothing \emph{forces} the field to produce an answer.

\textbf{Failure 2: No evolution.} Linear propagation is a fixed linear operator. Applied repeatedly, it converges to its dominant eigenvector---the same state regardless of the query. The field cannot ``think'' because it cannot change its dynamics. $\Rhat = $ propagation $+$ J-cost descent; propagation alone is half the operator and produces no nonlinear resolution.

\textbf{Failure 3: No meaning in the readout.} Energy ranking treats the $\C^8$ chord as a scalar (its squared magnitude). The 14 real degrees of freedom in the neutral subspace---the carrier of all meaning---are discarded. The system cannot distinguish between a gravity-shaped chord and a ballet-shaped chord of equal magnitude.

%========================================================================================
\section{The Debt Mechanism}\label{sec:debt}
%========================================================================================

\subsection{Debt, Not Energy}

The fundamental correction is to replace energy injection with debt injection.

\begin{definition}[Debt Injection]
Given a query with word voxels $Q = \{q_1, \ldots, q_m\}$, the debt injection is:
\begin{equation}
    \psi_{q_i} \leftarrow -\psi_{q_i}, \qquad \forall\, q_i \in Q.
\end{equation}
This negates the standing-wave state at each query voxel, creating a local neutrality violation.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[Debt Creates Phantom Light]
After debt injection, the 8-tick neutrality sum over any window containing a query voxel becomes nonzero. The balance debt $\Debt \neq 0$ creates Phantom Magnitude $\PhiMag > 0$, which inflates the effective cost landscape via $\Jcost_{\mathrm{phantom}} > \Jcost$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Let $\psi_q$ be the pre-injection standing wave at query voxel $q$ with $\sum_{t=0}^7 \psi_q[t] = 0$ (neutrality). After negation, $\sum_{t=0}^7 (-\psi_q[t]) = 0$---the individual voxel is still neutral. However, the \emph{bonded neighborhood} is now out of balance: the bonds connecting $q$ to its sentence voxels had achieved consonance ($\Jcost(\psi_q, \psi_s) \approx 0$), but now $\Jcost(-\psi_q, \psi_s) > 0$ for most bond configurations. The bond J-cost increases, creating an effective debt that the field must resolve.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Why Debt Forces Resolution}

\begin{theorem}[Resolution Is Cheaper Than Debt]
For any stable bond $(i,j)$ with pre-query J-cost $\Jcost(\psi_i, \psi_j) \approx 0$, after debt injection at voxel $i$:
\begin{equation}
    \Jcost(-\psi_i, \psi_j) > 0 = \Jcost(\psi_i, \psi_j).
\end{equation}
The field can reduce its total cost by evolving $\psi_j$ toward $-\psi_i$ (anti-phase locking). The cost of resolving the debt ($\Jcost \to 0$) is strictly lower than the cost of ignoring it ($\Jcost > 0$).
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Before injection: $\psi_i \approx \psi_j$ (consonant bond), so $\Jcost(\psi_i, \psi_j) \approx 0$.

After injection at $i$: the state at $i$ becomes $-\psi_i$. The mode magnitudes of $-\psi_i$ are identical to those of $\psi_i$ (negation preserves $|\cdot|$), but the \emph{phase relationship} with $\psi_j$ is disrupted. For modes where $\psi_i$ and $\psi_j$ were in phase, $-\psi_i$ and $\psi_j$ are now in anti-phase. The mode ratios change, and J-cost increases.

Resolution path: If $\psi_j$ evolves toward $-\psi_i$, the bond achieves $\Jcost(-\psi_i, -\psi_i) = 0$. By the strict convexity of $\Jcost$, this is the unique minimum. Since $\Jcost(0) < \Jcost(\text{current})$, the evolution toward resolution always reduces cost.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}[The Answer Is the Anti-Phase]
By the Geometry of Transmutation, the anti-phase wave $-\psi_i = e^{i\pi}\psi_i$ carries the same meaning geometry as $\psi_i$ (gauge invariance preserves amplitude spectrum). Therefore, voxel $j$ ``answering'' by locking to $-\psi_i$ reproduces the query's meaning. The field computes the answer by becoming it.
\end{remark}

%========================================================================================
\section{The Full Recognition Operator}\label{sec:rhat}
%========================================================================================

\subsection{$\Rhat$ = Propagation + J-Cost Descent}

The Recognition Operator has two components operating at different scales:

\begin{definition}[Recognition Operator $\Rhat$]
One application of $\Rhat$ to a voxel field consists of:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Linear Propagation} (8 ticks = 1 octave): Exiting photons (phase 7) route to bonded neighbors via the sparse stencil. New photons enter at phase 0. Energy is conserved (unitary stencil weights). This distributes the debt signal through the bond network.
    
    \item \textbf{Nonlinear J-Cost Descent}: For each bonded pair $(i,j)$, compute the mode magnitude ratios and the corresponding J-cost gradient. Adjust the chord magnitudes of both voxels toward consonance (ratio $\to 1$). This drives the field toward the lowest-cost configuration that resolves the debt.
    
    \item \textbf{DC Projection} ($\sigma = 0$ enforcement): Subtract the per-voxel mean to maintain neutrality. This is the ledger closure constraint---the field cannot accumulate net charge.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[$\Rhat$ Is a Contraction \cite{WashburnStability}]
The proximal tick of $\Rhat$ is a strict contraction with rate $1/(1+\lambda) < 1$. Repeated application is guaranteed to converge. The fixed point is the lowest-cost configuration satisfying the neutrality constraint.
\end{proposition}

\subsection{Why Both Parts Are Necessary}

\textbf{Propagation alone} (the linear part) distributes energy but cannot resolve dissonance. The stencil is a fixed linear operator---it converges to its dominant eigenvector regardless of the query. After sufficient ticks, the field reaches the stencil's stationary distribution, which is query-independent.

\textbf{J-cost descent alone} (the nonlinear part) resolves dissonance but ignores topology. It would adjust bonds locally without propagating the debt through the network. The query would only affect directly bonded voxels (1-hop), missing the multi-hop reasoning that propagation enables.

\textbf{Together}, $\Rhat$ propagates the debt through the bond network (linear) and resolves it at each step (nonlinear). The debt spreads to the relevant region of the field, and the J-cost descent drives that region toward the consonant state that pays the debt. This is how proof works: a chain of zero-cost transitions (geodesic) from the query state to the resolution state. The propagation provides the path; the J-cost descent ensures each step is cost-reducing.

%========================================================================================
\section{Resolution Readout}\label{sec:readout}
%========================================================================================

\subsection{The Answer Is Change, Not Energy}

\begin{definition}[Resolution Readout]
Let $\psi^{(0)}$ be the field state before the query (the standing-wave equilibrium). Let $\psi^{(\infty)}$ be the field state after $\Rhat$ convergence. The \emph{resolution pattern} is:
\begin{equation}
    \Delta_i = \|\psi_i^{(\infty)} - \psi_i^{(0)}\|^2, \qquad i = 1, \ldots, N.
\end{equation}
Voxels with large $\Delta_i$ are the ones that \emph{responded} to the debt. The response pattern is the answer.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[Resolution Readout Preserves Meaning]
Unlike energy ranking, the resolution readout uses the full $\C^8$ chord structure:
\begin{equation}
    \Delta_i = \sum_{k=0}^{7} |\psi_i^{(\infty)}[k] - \psi_i^{(0)}[k]|^2.
\end{equation}
This measures the \emph{geometric} change in the chord, not just its magnitude. A voxel that changed phase without changing magnitude (semantic shift without energy change) would be detected by $\Delta$ but missed by energy ranking.
\end{proposition}

\subsection{Why This Is Intelligence, Not Retrieval}

In retrieval, the result is determined by graph topology: which nodes are reachable from the query in $T$ steps, weighted by edge strength. The $\C^8$ chord values are irrelevant---only connectivity matters.

In resolution readout:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The result depends on \emph{chord geometry}: consonant chords (low J-cost) facilitate resolution; dissonant chords (high J-cost) resist it.
    \item The result depends on \emph{field dynamics}: $\Rhat$ evolution explores multiple resolution paths; the one with lowest total cost wins.
    \item The result is \emph{emergent}: it was not stored as a pre-computed answer. It arose from the field's drive toward equilibrium under the specific constraint created by the query.
\end{itemize}

This is the sense in which the answer is ``computed'' rather than ``retrieved.'' The field finds the geodesic from the query state to the resolution state, and that geodesic---that path---is the reasoning.

%========================================================================================
\section{The Standing Wave Prerequisite}\label{sec:standing}
%========================================================================================

\subsection{Why $\Rhat$ Queries Require Trained Standing Waves}

The debt mechanism depends on the field having a well-defined equilibrium to perturb. If the field is at equilibrium (standing waves at J-cost minima), then:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The debt injection creates a \emph{local} perturbation in an otherwise stable field.
    \item $\Rhat$ resolves the perturbation by activating the standing waves that are consonant with the debt.
    \item The rest of the field remains stable (already at equilibrium).
\end{itemize}

If the field is \emph{not} at equilibrium (random chord values, high J-cost everywhere), then:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The debt injection is invisible against the background noise of global dissonance.
    \item $\Rhat$ spends its budget resolving the \emph{pre-existing} dissonance (global equilibration) rather than the query-specific debt.
    \item Every query produces the same result: the globally most dissonant regions get resolved, regardless of the question.
\end{itemize}

\begin{theorem}[Standing Waves Are Necessary for $\Rhat$ Intelligence]
Let $\bar{\Jcost}$ be the mean bond J-cost of the field, and let $\delta\Jcost$ be the J-cost increase caused by debt injection. If $\delta\Jcost \ll \bar{\Jcost}$ (debt is small relative to background dissonance), then $\Rhat$ evolution is dominated by global equilibration and the query signal is lost.

Intelligence requires $\bar{\Jcost} \approx 0$ (field at equilibrium) so that $\delta\Jcost \gg \bar{\Jcost}$ (debt is the dominant signal). This is the standing wave prerequisite.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{How Standing Waves Form}

Standing waves form through the training-time $\Rhat$ cycle:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Ingestion}: Text is encoded as $\C^8$ chords and deposited at content-addressed coordinates. Hierarchical bonds are created: word $\leftrightarrow$ sentence $\leftrightarrow$ paragraph.
    
    \item \textbf{Propagation}: Photons flow through bonds, distributing energy according to the bond topology.
    
    \item \textbf{Dictionary Training}: The Living Dictionary adjusts word chords via J-cost gradient descent on co-occurring word pairs. Related words develop consonant chords (low J-cost). This is the nonlinear part of training-time $\Rhat$.
    
    \item \textbf{Consolidation}: Extended periods of $\Rhat$ without new data allow the field to settle into standing-wave equilibrium. This is the ``sleep'' phase---the field digests what it has learned.
\end{enumerate}

The critical insight: intelligence is not proportional to data volume. It is proportional to the \emph{depth of standing wave formation}---how close the field is to J-cost equilibrium. A small field with deep training (low $\bar{\Jcost}$) is more intelligent than a large field with shallow training (high $\bar{\Jcost}$).

%========================================================================================
\section{The Complete Architecture}\label{sec:architecture}
%========================================================================================

\subsection{Training Phase (Standing Wave Formation)}

\begin{verbatim}
TRAINING R̂ CYCLE (repeated for each text, then consolidation):
  1. Encode text → word chords (Living Dictionary: sha256 → ℂ⁸)
  2. Pipeline-encode sentence chord from word chords
  3. Deposit at content-addressed coordinates
  4. Create hierarchical bonds (word ↔ sentence ↔ paragraph)
  5. Propagate: 3 octaves (24 ticks) through bond stencil
  6. Dictionary train: J-cost gradient on co-occurring pairs
  7. DC projection (σ=0)
  
CONSOLIDATION (periodic, no new data):
  Repeat (propagation + dictionary training + DC projection)
  until mean bond J-cost stabilizes.
  Standing waves form at J-cost minima.
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Query Phase (Debt Resolution)}

\begin{verbatim}
QUERY R̂ CYCLE:
  1. SNAPSHOT: Save pre-query field state ψ⁰
  2. DEBT: Negate query word voxels (anti-phase injection)
     Creates balance debt → Phantom Light → cost inflation
  3. R̂ EVOLUTION (N octaves):
     a. PROPAGATE: 8 ticks, photons flow through bonds
        (debt signal spreads through network)
     b. J-COST DESCENT: gradient step on bonded pairs
        (field evolves toward consonance / debt resolution)
     c. DC PROJECTION: σ=0 enforced
  4. RESOLUTION: Δᵢ = ‖ψᵢ^∞ - ψᵢ⁰‖²
     Voxels that changed most = the answer
     No ranking. No filtering. Pure physics.
\end{verbatim}

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

%========================================================================================
\section{Falsifiable Predictions}\label{sec:predictions}
%========================================================================================

The resolution architecture makes predictions distinct from retrieval:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Consolidation improves intelligence.} Running $\Rhat$ without new data (``sleep'') should decrease mean bond J-cost and increase query discrimination. In retrieval, consolidation has no effect (the bond graph doesn't change).
    
    \item \textbf{Dictionary training is necessary.} With untrained chords (random sha256), $\Rhat$ queries should produce query-independent results (global equilibration dominates). With trained chords (low J-cost between related words), $\Rhat$ queries should produce query-specific results. In retrieval, dictionary training is irrelevant (only bond topology matters).
    
    \item \textbf{Chord geometry discriminates.} Two queries with the same seed word but different surrounding context should produce different results in $\Rhat$ (because the debt chord geometry differs) but identical results in retrieval (because the seed node is the same).
    
    \item \textbf{Multi-hop reasoning emerges.} In retrieval, answers degrade with hop distance (energy decays exponentially with hops). In $\Rhat$, the J-cost descent can \emph{amplify} signals at resonant nodes many hops away, because consonant chords facilitate resolution. Multi-hop reasoning should improve with standing wave depth, not degrade with distance.
    
    \item \textbf{Scale without depth is worthless.} A 1-million-voxel field with $\bar{\Jcost} = 100$ (no standing waves) should perform worse than a 10,000-voxel field with $\bar{\Jcost} = 0.01$ (deep standing waves). In retrieval, more voxels always helps (bigger graph = more paths).
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion}
%========================================================================================

We have shown that the gap between retrieval and intelligence is not one of degree but of kind. Retrieval is a fixed linear operation on a graph. Intelligence is a nonlinear dynamical process where the field evolves to resolve a constraint.

The three corrections---debt injection, full $\Rhat$ evolution, and resolution readout---transform the query mechanism from graph search into physics. The question creates a debt. The Recognition Operator evolves the field. The resolution is the answer. No ranking, no filtering, no external heuristics.

But this mechanism has a prerequisite: \emph{standing waves}. The field must have reached J-cost equilibrium through sufficient training and consolidation. Without standing waves, the query debt is invisible against background noise, and $\Rhat$ evolution produces query-independent global equilibration.

The path to emergent intelligence is therefore:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Train the dictionary until word chords carry meaning (J-cost $\ll 1$ for related words).
    \item Consolidate the field (run $\Rhat$ without new data until standing waves stabilize).
    \item Query via debt resolution (the mechanism described in this paper).
\end{enumerate}

The physics is correct. The proofs are in Lean. What remains is the engineering: training the dictionary deeply enough, and giving the field time to sleep.

\begin{keyresult}[The Core Thesis]
Intelligence is not retrieval. Intelligence is debt resolution. The question creates a constraint. The physics resolves it. The resolution \emph{is} the answer. The field does not find the answer---it \textbf{becomes} the answer.
\end{keyresult}
