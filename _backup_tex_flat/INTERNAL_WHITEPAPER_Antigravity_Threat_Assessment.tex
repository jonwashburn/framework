\section{Executive Summary}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This document analyzes three historical cases of gravity-anomaly research under the following assumptions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Recognition Science (RS) is true} --- gravity is a Ledger Constraint, not a fundamental force.
    \item \textbf{Their discoveries were valid} --- they found real ``seams'' in the metric.
    \item \textbf{They were systematically neutralized} --- murdered, discredited, or forced into silence.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Core Finding}
If RS is true, these researchers were not stopped because they were wrong. They were stopped because they were \emph{right} --- and they failed to implement adequate countermeasures.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{The Three Cases: What They Found}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Ning Li (1943--2021)}

\begin{tabular}{@{}ll@{}}
\textbf{Affiliation:} & University of Alabama, Huntsville; AC Gravity LLC \\
\textbf{Key Work:} & ``Effects of a Gravitomagnetic Field on Pure Superconductors'' \\
                   & (Phys.\ Rev.\ D, Vol.\ 43, 1991) \\
\end{tabular}

\subsubsection*{The Claim}
Rotating ions in a superconductor produce a gravitomagnetic field $\sim 10^{11}$ times larger than General Relativity predicts. This ``AC Gravity'' could theoretically produce thrust without propellant.

\subsubsection*{RS Interpretation: The Coherence Gate}
Li discovered the \textbf{Coherence Gate}. In RS terms, phase-coherent matter (BEC/superconductor) allows the Ledger to process mass-updates as a single macro-object, unlocking the normally-cancelled gravitomagnetic source term.

\subsubsection*{What Happened}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{1999:} Founded AC Gravity LLC.
    \item \textbf{2001:} Received \$448,970 DoD contract for ``gravity modification.''
    \item \textbf{2002:} Obtained Top Secret clearance; stopped publishing.
    \item \textbf{2003--2021:} Complete public silence. No papers, no conferences, no patents.
    \item \textbf{2021:} Died. Cause not widely publicized.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Pattern:} Recruited $\to$ Classified $\to$ Silenced $\to$ Died.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Eugene Podkletnov (b.\ 1955)}

\begin{tabular}{@{}ll@{}}
\textbf{Affiliation:} & Tampere University of Technology (Finland); \\
                      & Moscow Chemical Research Centre \\
\textbf{Key Work:} & arXiv:cond-mat/9701074 (1997) \\
\end{tabular}

\subsubsection*{The Claim}
A rotating YBCO superconductor disk produces 0.3--2.1\% weight reduction in objects above it. The effect was strongest at specific ``critical'' rotation speeds.

\subsubsection*{RS Interpretation: The Frequency Lock}
Podkletnov discovered the \textbf{Frequency Lock}. The ``critical speeds'' correspond to 8-tick/$\phi$ resonance harmonics. At these frequencies, the local ILG weight kernel $w(k,a)$ drops, reducing effective gravitational coupling.

\subsubsection*{What Happened}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{1992:} Submitted paper to \emph{Physica C}; co-author (Nieminen) withdrew under institutional pressure.
    \item \textbf{1996:} Submitted to \emph{Journal of Physics D}; leaked to media before publication; retracted.
    \item \textbf{1997:} Published on arXiv (not peer-reviewed).
    \item \textbf{1997--present:} Left academia. Current status unclear. Some reports place him in Russia working on classified projects.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Pattern:} Published $\to$ Media Leak $\to$ Retraction $\to$ Academic Exile $\to$ Recruited (?) by state actor.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{John Searl (b.\ 1932)}

\begin{tabular}{@{}ll@{}}
\textbf{Affiliation:} & Independent researcher (UK) \\
\textbf{Key Work:} & The ``Searl Effect Generator'' (SEG); \\
                   & self-published ``Law of the Squares'' \\
\end{tabular}

\subsubsection*{The Claim}
Rotating magnetic rollers arranged in specific geometric ratios produce:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Anomalous thrust (levitation)
    \item Cooling of the device and surroundings
    \item Unusual electrical phenomena (ionization glow)
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{RS Interpretation: The Geometric Pump}
Searl discovered the \textbf{Geometric Pump}. His ``Law of the Squares'' encodes $\phi$-ratio resonances. The cooling signature is the RS ``Entropic Pump'' --- the device orders the local vacuum, absorbing thermal entropy to pay the $J$-cost.

\subsubsection*{What Happened}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{1960s--1980s:} Built multiple prototypes. Some allegedly flew.
    \item \textbf{1982:} UK government raided his property; equipment confiscated; officially for ``electricity theft.''
    \item \textbf{1983:} Jailed for 10 months.
    \item \textbf{Post-1983:} Lost all prototypes. Spent decades attempting to rebuild.
    \item \textbf{Present:} Elderly, marginalized, no institutional support.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Pattern:} Demonstrated $\to$ Raided $\to$ Imprisoned $\to$ Assets Seized $\to$ Marginalized.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{The RS Physics: Deep Dive}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section provides the mathematical foundation for why---under Recognition Science---the Li, Podkletnov, and Searl effects are \emph{expected} rather than anomalous.

\subsection{Foundational RS Equations}

Recognition Science derives all physics from the \textbf{Recognition Composition Law (RCL)}:
\begin{equation}
J(xy) + J(x/y) = 2J(x)J(y) + 2J(x) + 2J(y)
\end{equation}
This functional equation has a unique normalized solution:
\begin{equation}
J(x) = \frac{1}{2}\left(x + \frac{1}{x}\right) - 1
\end{equation}
The $J$-cost is the fundamental ``price'' of any configuration in the Ledger. Gravity emerges as the constraint that minimizes global $J$.

\subsubsection{The ILG Weight Kernel}

In the \textbf{Information-Limited Gravity (ILG)} formalism, the effective gravitational ``weight'' of an object is not constant but depends on its dynamical timescale:
\begin{equation}
w(T_{\text{dyn}}, \tau_0) = 1 + C_{\text{lag}} \cdot \left[\left(\frac{T_{\text{dyn}}}{\tau_0}\right)^\alpha - 1\right]
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\tau_0 = \frac{1}{8 \ln \phi} \approx 7.3 \times 10^{-15}$ s (the recognition tick)
    \item $\alpha = \frac{1 - \phi^{-1}}{2} \approx 0.191$ (the ILG exponent)
    \item $C_{\text{lag}} = \phi^{-5} \approx 0.09$ (the RS-derived coupling)
    \item $\phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$ (the golden ratio, \emph{forced} by T6 of the Forcing Chain)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Key Insight:} If $T_{\text{dyn}}$ can be modified (by coherence, rotation, or geometry), then $w$ deviates from unity---the object's effective weight changes.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Case A: Ning Li --- The Coherence Gate}

\subsubsection{The Standard GR Prediction}

In General Relativity, rotating mass produces a \textbf{gravitomagnetic field} $\mathbf{B}_g$ analogous to the magnetic field from moving charge. The gravitomagnetic potential satisfies:
\begin{equation}
\nabla^2 V_i = 4\pi G \rho v_i
\end{equation}
For ordinary matter, the gravitomagnetic effects are minuscule ($\sim 10^{-14}$ relative to Newtonian gravity).

\subsubsection{Li's Claim}

Li proposed that in a superconductor, the internal gravitomagnetic field is:
\begin{equation}
B_g(z) \approx B_{g,0} + \frac{\mu_g m}{q \mu} B_0
\end{equation}
where $\mu_g$ is the ``gravitomagnetic permeability'' of the superconductor. She claimed $\mu_g / \mu \sim 10^{11}$---an enhancement of eleven orders of magnitude.

\subsubsection{The RS Explanation: Coherence Multiplier}

In RS, the effective source term for any field equation is modulated by the \textbf{Reciprocity Skew} $\sigma$:
\begin{equation}
\rho_{\text{eff}} = \rho \cdot \Gamma(\sigma)
\end{equation}
where $\Gamma(\sigma)$ is the \textbf{Coherence Gain}:
\begin{equation}
\Gamma(\sigma) = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } \sigma \gg 0 \quad \text{(incoherent, random phase)} \\
N & \text{if } \sigma \to 0 \quad \text{(coherent, locked phase)}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
Here $N$ is the number of coherent particles. In a superconductor with $N \sim 10^{22}$ Cooper pairs, the \emph{effective} gravitomagnetic source is amplified by $\sqrt{N} \sim 10^{11}$.

\textbf{Why it works (The Narrative):}
Standard physics treats gravity as a curvature of spacetime caused by mass-energy. RS treats gravity as a \textbf{Ledger Constraint}---the cost of maintaining separate coordinates for distinct entities.

Normally, the \textbf{Recognition Operator} $\hat{R}$ processes matter as a collection of trillions of independent, phase-incoherent events. Their individual gravitomagnetic vectors point in random directions, and the Ledger averages them to zero (decoherence). This is why a spinning brick doesn't fly.

In Li's superconductor (a Bose-Einstein Condensate), the entire disk shares a single macroscopic quantum phase $\theta$. The Ledger no longer sees $10^{22}$ separate particles; it sees \textbf{one giant super-particle}. The random cancellation stops. The gravitomagnetic vectors sum constructively. The Ledger is forced to balance this massive coherent input with an equally massive output: a measurable gravitomagnetic field. Li didn't ``create'' gravity; she stopped the Ledger from cancelling it out.

\subsubsection{RS Prediction vs.\ Li's Data}

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}lcc@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Parameter} & \textbf{Li's Claim} & \textbf{RS Prediction} \\
\midrule
Enhancement factor & $\sim 10^{11}$ & $\sqrt{N} \sim 10^{11}$ \\
Coherence dependence & Yes (below $T_c$) & Yes (forced by $\Gamma(\sigma)$) \\
Sign flip on reversal & Expected & \textbf{Required} (vector field) \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Comparison of Li's claims with RS predictions.}
\end{table}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Case B: Podkletnov --- The Frequency Lock}

\subsubsection{The Experimental Observation}

Podkletnov reported 0.3--2.1\% weight reduction in objects above a rotating YBCO disk. Critically, the effect was \emph{not linear} with rotation speed---it peaked at specific ``critical'' RPMs.

\subsubsection{The RS Explanation: 8-Tick Resonance}

The universe updates on a discrete \textbf{8-tick cycle} with period $8\tau_0$. If a rotating object's passage frequency $f_{\text{rot}}$ matches a harmonic of this fundamental clock:
\begin{equation}
f_{\text{rot}} = \frac{n}{8 \tau_0 \cdot \phi^k}, \quad n, k \in \mathbb{Z}
\end{equation}
then the ILG weight kernel $w$ experiences a resonant minimum.

\textbf{The Narrative: Ledger Lag and Computational Cost}
In RS, ``Mass'' is effectively the \textbf{computational cost} required for the Ledger to update an object's position. A heavy object requires more processing steps to move than a light one. This processing isn't instantaneous; it has a characteristic ``Lag'' ($C_{\text{lag}}$) governed by the universal update rate (the 8-tick cycle).

When an object rotates at a random speed, its position updates are out of sync with the universal refresh rate. The Ledger has to interpolate, creating ``friction'' or ``drag'' in the metric. We perceive this drag as \textbf{Inertial Mass}.

Podkletnov's ``Critical Speeds'' are simply the frequencies that \textbf{synchronize} the object's motion with the Ledger's clock. When the rotation locks to the 8-tick harmonic, the object moves \emph{with} the refresh cycle, not against it. The interpolation steps vanish. The ``computational cost'' drops. The Ledger Lag decreases.

To an outside observer, it looks like the object lost weight. In reality, it just became \textbf{computationally efficient} for the universe to simulate.

\subsubsection{Derivation of Critical Speeds}

Given:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\tau_0 \approx 7.3 \times 10^{-15}$ s
    \item Disk radius $r = 0.1375$ m (275 mm diameter)
    \item $\phi^5 \approx 11.09$ (a common RS harmonic)
\end{itemize}

The ``fundamental'' resonant rotation rate would be:
\begin{equation}
f_1 = \frac{1}{8 \tau_0 \cdot \phi^5} \approx 1.5 \times 10^{12} \text{ Hz}
\end{equation}
This is far too high for mechanical rotation. However, RS allows for \textbf{sub-harmonic locking}: the $n$-th sub-harmonic at:
\begin{equation}
f_n = \frac{f_1}{n}
\end{equation}
For $n \sim 10^9$ (a reasonable sub-harmonic depth), we get:
\begin{equation}
f_{\text{crit}} \sim 1500 \text{ Hz} \sim 90,000 \text{ RPM}
\end{equation}
Podkletnov operated at $\sim 5000$ RPM. This suggests either:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The effect couples through the \emph{lattice vibration frequency} (phonons), not mechanical rotation.
    \item A different harmonic structure involving the AC magnetic field frequency ($10^6$--$10^8$ Hz in his setup).
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{The ``Slowing Down'' Anomaly}

Podkletnov noted that the effect \emph{increased} when rotation was slowed from maximum speed. In RS, this is explained by \textbf{phase-lock acquisition}: at high speed, the system overshoots the resonance; slowing down allows it to ``lock'' onto the correct 8-tick harmonic.

\begin{equation}
\frac{dw}{df}\bigg|_{f = f_{\text{crit}}} = 0 \quad \text{(local minimum)}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{RS Predictions for Podkletnov Replication}

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}lc@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Prediction} & \textbf{RS Signature} \\
\midrule
Effect is discrete (step-function) & Yes (Banding Falsifier) \\
Effect scales with coherence length $\xi$ & Yes \\
Effect depends on AC field frequency & Yes (8-tick coupling) \\
Effect vanishes if $T > T_c$ & Yes (Coherence Gate) \\
Effect does NOT reverse sign on rotation reversal & \textbf{Correct} (scalar, not vector) \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{RS predictions for Podkletnov effect.}
\end{table}

\textbf{Critical distinction:} Li's effect is a \emph{vector} (gravitomagnetic, reverses sign). Podkletnov's effect is a \emph{scalar} (weight modification, same sign regardless of rotation direction). RS accommodates both via different coupling mechanisms.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Case C: Searl --- The Geometric Pump}

\subsubsection{The Claimed Phenomena}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Lift/Thrust:} Device levitates without conventional propulsion.
    \item \textbf{Cooling:} Ambient temperature drops near the device.
    \item \textbf{Ionization:} Pink/blue glow around the device (corona discharge).
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{The RS Explanation: $\phi$-Spiral Geometry}

Searl's ``Law of the Squares'' encodes specific ratios for roller sizes and positions. In RS, these correspond to \textbf{$\phi$-quantized pitch families}.

The log-spiral rotor path in RS is:
\begin{equation}
r(\theta) = r_0 \cdot \phi^{\kappa \theta / 2\pi}
\end{equation}
where $\kappa \in \mathbb{Z}$ is the pitch index. The per-turn growth ratio is exactly $\phi^\kappa$.

If Searl's geometry approximates $\kappa = 1$ or $\kappa = 2$, the device creates a \textbf{standing wave} in the Recognition Field.

\subsubsection{The Cooling Signature: Entropic Pump}

Standard thermodynamics: $dS \geq 0$ (entropy increases).

RS allows \textbf{local entropy decrease} if paid for by increased order in the vacuum (the Ledger). The device acts as a \textbf{Maxwell's Demon for the metric}:
\begin{equation}
\Delta S_{\text{device}} + \Delta S_{\text{vacuum}} \geq 0
\end{equation}
If $\Delta S_{\text{vacuum}} < 0$ (vacuum becomes more ordered), then $\Delta S_{\text{device}} > 0$ can manifest as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Heat absorption from environment $\to$ \textbf{Cooling}
    \item Entropy export as ordered motion $\to$ \textbf{Thrust}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{The Narrative: Ordering the Vacuum}
Standard physics assumes the vacuum is empty. RS knows the vacuum is full of \textbf{Phantom Light} (potential recognition events). This background field has high entropy (disorder).

Searl's device is a \textbf{Geometric Filter}. Its $\phi$-ratio rollers create a geometry that only allows certain ``ordered'' vacuum modes to exist within it. It physically pushes out the disordered modes.

But order isn't free. To lower the entropy of the local vacuum (ordering the metric), the device must pay a cost. It pays this cost by absorbing thermal energy from the air and converting it into structural order.

This is the \textbf{Entropic Pump}. It eats heat and excretes order (thrust). The cooling isn't a side effect; it is the fuel source. It proves the device is interacting with the deep structure of the Ledger, not just pushing air.

\subsubsection{The Ionization Signature}

RS predicts that high-coherence fields create local \textbf{Reciprocity Skew gradients}. These gradients can:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ionize ambient air (energy transferred from vacuum fluctuations)
    \item Create visible glow (photon emission from locally excited vacuum)
\end{itemize}
This matches Searl's reported ``corona'' effect.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Unified RS Model: The Three Layers}

The three researchers discovered three orthogonal layers of the same underlying mechanism:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}llll@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Layer} & \textbf{Researcher} & \textbf{RS Mechanism} & \textbf{Coupling} \\
\midrule
Material & Li & Coherence Gain $\Gamma(\sigma)$ & Phase lock $\to$ $N^{1/2}$ boost \\
Temporal & Podkletnov & 8-Tick Resonance & $f_{\text{rot}} \to$ harmonic lock \\
Spatial & Searl & $\phi$-Geometry & $r(\theta) \to$ standing wave \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{The three layers of metric engineering.}
\end{table}

\textbf{To maximize effect:} Combine all three layers:
\begin{equation}
\text{Effect} \propto \Gamma(\sigma) \cdot R(f) \cdot G(\kappa)
\end{equation}
where $R(f)$ is the resonance factor and $G(\kappa)$ is the geometric coupling.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Testable Predictions}

If RS is true, the following \textbf{novel predictions} should hold:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Coherence Threshold:} Effect onset is sharp at $T_c$, not gradual.
    \item \textbf{Discrete Bands:} Weight loss occurs only at specific rotation speeds (not continuous).
    \item \textbf{$\phi$-Ratio Dependence:} Geometric ratios near $\phi$ outperform arbitrary ratios.
    \item \textbf{Cooling Signature:} Any working device must absorb heat from environment.
    \item \textbf{8-Tick Modulation:} Pulsing the drive at $8\tau_0$ harmonics enhances effect.
    \item \textbf{Cross-Coupling:} Adding coherent material to a Podkletnov disk increases effect (Li + Podkletnov synergy).
\end{enumerate}

These predictions are encoded as formal falsifiers in \texttt{IndisputableMonolith.Flight.Falsifiers}.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Threat Model: Who and Why}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{The ``Why'' (Under RS Assumptions)}

If Recognition Science is true, these researchers weren't just building propulsion. They were demonstrating \textbf{Admin Access to Reality}.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}lll@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Threat Domain} & \textbf{What They Threatened} & \textbf{Consequence} \\
\midrule
Military & Air/Space superiority & Loss of force projection monopoly \\
Energy & Centralized power grids & Collapse of petrochemical/utility control \\
Consciousness & The $\Theta$-field & Loss of information asymmetry \\
Ontological & The ``Separation Illusion'' & Collapse of individualist control structures \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Threat domains and consequences of metric engineering disclosure.}
\end{table}

\textbf{Key Insight:} The threat is not ``better technology.'' The threat is \textbf{the end of scarcity and secrecy as control mechanisms}.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{The ``Who'' (Tiered Actor Model)}

\subsubsection{Tier 1: The Breakaway Civilization}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Description:} Deep-state factions (US/NATO/Russia/China) who already possess this technology.
    \item \textbf{Motive:} Maintain exclusivity. Civilian rediscovery threatens their monopoly.
    \item \textbf{Methods:} Classification, recruitment, ``accidents,'' discreditation.
    \item \textbf{Evidence:} Li's Top Secret clearance $\to$ silence. Podkletnov's rumored Russian state work.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Tier 2: The Stability Custodians}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Description:} Trans-national coordination groups (banking, intelligence) tasked with preventing civilizational shock.
    \item \textbf{Motive:} Rate-limiting. Humanity isn't ``ready'' for metric engineering.
    \item \textbf{Methods:} Media manipulation, academic gatekeeping, legal harassment.
    \item \textbf{Evidence:} Podkletnov's media leak and retraction. Searl's ``electricity theft'' pretext.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Tier 3: The Ledger Itself (Systemic)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Description:} The simulation's error-correction mechanism.
    \item \textbf{Motive:} Maintain coherence. Premature metric hacking creates unsustainable Reciprocity Skew.
    \item \textbf{Methods:} ``Probability skews'' --- bad luck, health issues, ``random'' violence.
    \item \textbf{Evidence:} Loureiro's shooter (no clear motive, suicide after). Li's quiet death.
\end{itemize}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Lessons Learned: What They Did Wrong}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}lll@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Researcher} & \textbf{Fatal Mistake} & \textbf{Consequence} \\
\midrule
Li & Accepted DoD funding/classification & Became owned; died unknown \\
Podkletnov & Submitted without media/legal protection & Leak used to discredit \\
Searl & Built hardware without legal infrastructure & Assets seized; no recourse \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Common failure modes in historical antigravity research.}
\end{table}

\textbf{Common Thread:} They tried to work \emph{within} the existing system (academia, government, patents) without understanding that the system is designed to absorb or destroy such discoveries.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{RSRI Countermeasures: The ``Indisputable Monolith'' Strategy}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have adopted the opposite approach: \textbf{Total Transparency + Formal Verification + Decentralized Publication}.

\subsection{The ``Too Big to Kill'' Doctrine}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mechanism:} All core theory is published openly (arXiv, blockchain, open-source repo).
    \item \textbf{Effect:} Eliminating the founder does not eliminate the knowledge. The Lean proofs are self-verifying.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The ``No Single Point of Failure'' Doctrine}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mechanism:} 10+ full-time scientists, each with overlapping knowledge.
    \item \textbf{Effect:} Tier 1 actors cannot ``recruit'' or ``silence'' a single target to stop the project.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The ``Formal Verification'' Doctrine}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mechanism:} Every claim is a theorem in Lean 4. The compiler is the arbiter.
    \item \textbf{Effect:} Discreditation attacks (``crackpot,'' ``pseudoscience'') fail against machine-checked proofs.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The ``Patent Thicket'' Doctrine}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mechanism:} 300--400 patents filed across multiple jurisdictions.
    \item \textbf{Effect:} Seizure or suppression in one country does not eliminate IP protection globally.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The ``Public Figure'' Doctrine}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mechanism:} Principal investigator maintains public visibility.
    \item \textbf{Effect:} ``Accidents'' become implausible; pattern becomes obvious.
\end{itemize}

\section{Publication Strategy: The ``Loureiro Lesson''}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Professor Nuno Loureiro was the Director of MIT's Plasma Science and Fusion Center. He was murdered on December 15, 2025. Whether or not his death was related to his research, it demonstrates that \textbf{prominence is not protection}.

\subsection*{Our Strategy}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Publish Early, Publish Often:} Do not wait for ``perfect'' papers. Get claims timestamped immediately.
    \item \textbf{Publish Redundantly:} Same content on multiple platforms (Mirror, Arweave, arXiv).
    \item \textbf{Publish Popularly:} A book, a documentary, a podcast series. Make the ideas ``too famous to suppress.''
    \item \textbf{Publish Formally:} Lean proofs are the ultimate defense. They cannot be ``retracted'' or ``discredited.''

\section{Conclusion: The Cost of Being Right}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Li, Podkletnov, and Searl were right. Under RS, their discoveries are not anomalies; they are the expected behavior of coherent matter interacting with the Ledger.

They failed not because their science was wrong, but because they did not understand the \emph{political physics} of their discoveries. They tried to work through institutions that are structurally incapable of allowing such knowledge to spread.

\textbf{RSRI's mission is to succeed where they failed:} to get the knowledge out \emph{before} it can be contained, using formal verification as an unfalsifiable anchor and decentralized publication as an un-erasable record.

The Ledger rewards those who serve Reciprocity. Our intent is not power or profit; it is the liberation of physics from artificial scarcity. If the Tier 3 ``systemic'' threat is real, alignment with the Ledger's own purpose (universal recognition) is our best protection.

\section{RS Falsifier Suite}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All claims must pass these tests before acceptance:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{VacuumTestFalsifier:} Effect persists at $P < 10^{-6}$ Torr
    \item \textbf{SignFlipFalsifier:} Reversing rotation reverses effect vector
    \item \textbf{CoherenceGateFalsifier:} Effect vanishes if $T > T_c$
    \item \textbf{BandingFalsifier:} Effect is discrete (step-function) with rotation speed
    \item \textbf{PhaseLockFalsifier:} Continuous forcing degrades performance
\end{enumerate}
