% ============================================
% RECOGNITION: THE THEORY OF US
% NEW CHAPTERS TO ADD (Placeholders)
% ============================================
% 
% Approach: ADD these new chapters to existing structure.
% No moving, merging, or consolidating existing content.
%
% 4 NEW CHAPTERS REQUIRED:
%   1. The Ledger (Part I: The Foundation)
%   2. The Octave (Part I: The Foundation)
%   3. The Grammar (Part I: The Foundation)
%   4. The Choice (Part III: The Soul)
%

% NEW PART I: THE FOUNDATION (Genesis)
% Insert BEFORE existing opening chapters

\textit{The unseen machine that runs reality.}

% ============================================
% NEW CHAPTER: THE LEDGER
% ============================================
\chapter{The Ledger}
\label{ch:ledger}

% WHAT THIS CHAPTER COVERS:
%
% 1. THE AUDIT
%    - The universe is an audit
%    - Existence is what survives the closing of the books
%    - "To exist is to be counted"
%
% 2. THE TICK
%    - Time is not a dimension; it is a processing cycle
%    - The universe ticks (discrete, not continuous)
%    - The Micro-period (τ) — the fundamental tick
%
% 3. ZERO-PARAMETER
%    - Reality has no arbitrary settings
%    - No "knobs" to tune
%    - The universe self-calibrates
%
% 4. THE THREE AXIOMS
%    - Closure: the books must be able to close
%    - Serialization: updates have an order (one posting per tick)
%    - Pressure: mismatch must be expensive
%
% 5. ENTROPY AS COST
%    - Entropy is the cost of writing to the Ledger
%    - Not "disorder" but "the price of recording"
%    - The Arrow of Time is the direction of the Audit
%
% SOURCE MATERIAL:
%    - ARCHITECTURE_PART_OUTLINE.md: Zero-Parameter, Law of Existence, Entropy

The books must close. What remains is real.

% NEW CHAPTER: THE OCTAVE
% ============================================
\chapter{The Octave}
\label{ch:octave}

% WHAT THIS CHAPTER COVERS:
%
% 1. THE UNIVERSE IS MUSIC
%    - This is mechanism, not metaphor
%    - Reality operates as resonance, not as force
%
% 2. THE 8-PHASE CYCLE (RRF)
%    - Everything breathes in an 8-phase rhythm
%    - The Octave Layer structure:
%      * State space
%      * Phase clock (Fin 8)
%      * Strain functional (J)
%      * Admissibility predicate
%      * Evolution step
%
% 3. THE PHI-LADDER
%    - The Golden Ratio (φ) as the scaling factor
%    - Scales are not random; they are notes on a cosmic piano
%    - φ^n spacing across domains
%
% 4. RESONANCE AS MECHANISM
%    - Interaction is phase-locking, not force-exchange
%    - "Energy minimization" is dissonance reduction
%    - Stable matter is a chord that rings true
%
% 5. CROSS-OCTAVE INVARIANCE
%    - Quality in one domain predicts quality in another
%    - You can HEAR if a fold is wrong (Sonification)
%    - Same pattern, different octave
%

%    - Source-Super-rrf.txt: @RRF_PRIMER, OctaveKernel documentation

% ============================================
% NEW CHAPTER: THE GRAMMAR
% ============================================
\chapter{The Grammar}
\label{ch:grammar}

% WHAT THIS CHAPTER COVERS:
%
% 1. CHANGE HAS A SYNTAX
%    - Not everything can happen
%    - There are only 5 legal operations
%
% 2. LNAL: THE FIVE VERBS
%    - LISTEN: receive information
%    - LOCK: commit to a state
%    - BALANCE: conserve across a transaction
%    - FOLD: compress / represent
%    - BRAID: entangle / couple
%
% 3. WHAT THE GRAMMAR FORBIDS
%    - Conservation laws are grammar refusing illegal conjugations
%    - "You cannot say that" = "That violates conservation"
%
% 4. SPACE AS QUOTIENT
%    - Space is not a container
%    - Space is what the Ledger cannot tell apart
%    - Indistinguishability → "same place"
%    - Configurations, events, recognizers
%
% 5. LIGHT AS ADJACENCY
%    - Light does not "travel"
%    - Light is the ripple of adjacency in the Ledger
%    - One step per tick = c
%    - The speed limit is grammatical, not physical
%
% SOURCE MATERIAL:
%    - ARCHITECTURE_PART_OUTLINE.md: Grammar of Change, Space from Recognition
%    - Source-Super-rrf.txt: LNAL documentation

% ============================================
% NEW CHAPTER: THE CHOICE (Add to Soul section)
% ============================================
\chapter{The Choice}
\label{ch:choice}

% WHAT THIS CHAPTER COVERS:
%
% 1. FREE WILL WITHIN THE LEDGER
%    - Agency is not an illusion
%    - Agency is a degree of freedom within the Grammar
%
% 2. THE VERBS AND CHOICE
%    - The 5 Verbs (LNAL) define what CAN happen
%    - Choice operates within those bounds
%    - Not "anything is possible" but "something is possible"
%
% 3. STEERING WITHIN LAW
%    - What it means to "steer" within a lawful universe
%    - The space of legal moves
%    - Creativity as exploration of the grammar
%
% 4. THE WEIGHT OF CHOICE
%    - Every choice writes to the Ledger
%    - The moral weight of decision (bridge to Ethics)
%    - Why what you do matters
%
% 5. THE PARADOX RESOLVED
%    - Determinism vs. free will is a false dichotomy
%    - The Grammar constrains; it does not compel
%    - You are the pattern that chooses
