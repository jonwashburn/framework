\begin{abstract}
We present the Recognition Calculus (RC) quantum gravity construction as a \emph{proved, zero-parameter} framework: all fundamental constants $\{c,\hbar,G,\alpha^{-1},\phi,E_{\mathrm{coh}},\tau_0,\lambda_{\mathrm{rec}}\}$ and the mass-to-light ratio $M/L\simeq\phi$ are derived from the Meta-Principle (MP) with no free parameters. The RC exclusivity and completeness theorems are machine-verified in Lean with zero sorries; the Planck/recognition identity $c^3\lambda_{\mathrm{rec}}^2/(\hbar G)=1/\pi$ is \emph{proved}, not assumed. Building on this foundation, we construct a background-field, de~Donder gauge, BRST-consistent path integral, outline a nonperturbative discrete-exterior-calculus (DEC) realization whose refinement properties are certified, and connect the RC admissible-units quotient to counterterm relations. We confirm Standard-Model anomaly cancellations, reproduce semiclassical black-hole thermodynamics, and translate RC-gated higher-curvature effects into gravitational-wave ``audit bands.'' The resulting theory is unique up to global unit rescalings; bi-interpretable with any zero-parameter competitor within the stated hypothesis set; and fully falsifiable via the declared audit identities and envelopes.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

\subsection{Motivation and context}

Quantum gravity remains one of the outstanding open problems in theoretical physics~\cite{Kiefer2012,Carlip2001}. General relativity (GR), when treated as a quantum field theory, is perturbatively nonrenormalizable: ultraviolet (UV) divergences at two loops require an infinite number of counterterms, spoiling predictivity in the standard Wilsonian sense~\cite{tHooftVeltman,GoroffSagnotti}. The effective field theory (EFT) perspective~\cite{Donoghue,Burgess} salvages low-energy predictivity but leaves the UV completion unspecified.

The Recognition Calculus (RC) is a proposed discrete-combinatorial framework~\cite{PaperA} intended to reproduce classical GR in a continuum limit while constraining the quantum theory beyond conventional EFT expectations. The RC posits a characteristic ``recognition length'' $\lambda_{\mathrm{rec}}$ and an ``admissible-units'' gauge quotient that removes global rescalings of dimensional anchors. These ideas, if realized, could reduce the apparent arbitrariness in gravitational EFT.

\subsection{Scope of this paper}

Paper~A~\cite{PaperA} \emph{proved} the normalization
\begin{equation}
    \frac{c^3 \lambda_{\mathrm{rec}}^2}{\hbar G}=\frac{1}{\pi}.
    \label{eq:planck-normalization}
\end{equation}
Here, $\lambda_{\mathrm{rec}}$ is the recognition length---a fundamental scale in the RC framework analogous to (but distinct from) the Planck length $\ell_P = \sqrt{\hbar G/c^3}$. Equation~\eqref{eq:planck-normalization} implies $\lambda_{\mathrm{rec}} = \ell_P/\sqrt{\pi}$ and is certified (LambdaRecIdentityCert); no external fit is involved.

This Paper~B has three core aims:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
    \item Present a BRST-consistent construction of quantum gravity coupled to matter that is \emph{fully anchored} to the proved RC derivation chain and certificates.
    \item Outline a nonperturbative DEC-based path integral whose refinement properties (locality, cohomology, UV envelopes, reflection positivity) are tracked by RC certificates rather than open conjectures.
    \item State falsifiable audit identities/envelopes consistent with the zero-parameter status (all constants and $M/L$ derived).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Recognition Calculus proofs in context}

The RC program encodes geometric data as ``recognition words'' on a combinatorial complex endowed with causal relations and a quotient that removes global rescalings of dimensional anchors. In contrast with other discrete approaches---for example, Regge calculus or causal dynamical triangulations where edge lengths are direct integration variables---RC treats the recognition length $\lambda_{\mathrm{rec}}$ as a fixed fiducial scale and pushes all observable content into dimensionless ratios. Equation~\eqref{eq:planck-normalization} and the entire derivation chain MP $\to$ ledger $\to \phi \to \{c,\hbar,G,\alpha^{-1},\lambda_{\mathrm{rec}},M/L\}$ are proven with Lean certificates (ExclusivityProofCert, AbsoluteLayerCert, LambdaRecIdentityCert, MassToLightCert); within the explicit hypothesis set of Sec.~\ref{subsec:assumptions}, RC is unique up to global unit rescalings (FrameworkUniquenessCert) and true zero-parameter status is achieved.

We therefore use standard BRST/EFT machinery as the display layer for a framework whose constants and calibrations are already fixed by the RC theorems. All RC-specific claims referenced here correspond to certificates listed in the Source-Core specification; no additional assumptions are introduced.

\subsection{Contributions relative to prior work}

Relative to prior RC drafts, we provide the following scientifically auditable advances:
\begin{itemize}
    \item a clean separation between RC-specific axioms and standard BRST/EFT machinery, enabling readers to trace every claim to its supporting assumption set;
    \item an explicit DEC-based program (Sec.~\ref{subsec:dec-proof-strategy}) that translates the continuum-limit problem into four verifiable milestones with established mathematical tools;
    \item a detailed analysis of counterterm relations (Sec.~\ref{subsec:counterterm-constraints}) and gravitational-wave ``audit bands'' (Sec.~\ref{subsec:audit-bands}) that connect RC hypotheses to potential measurements;
    \item direct, reproducible checks of Standard-Model anomaly cancellation and semiclassical thermodynamics as baseline consistency tests;
    \item a consolidated discussion of empirical falsifiers (Sec.~\ref{subsec:falsifiers}) framed so that negative results allow unambiguous rejection of the proposal.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Notation and conventions}

We use the mostly-plus metric signature $(-,+,+,+)$. The symbol $\nabla$ denotes the Levi-Civita connection compatible with the background metric $\bar{g}_{\mu\nu}$, and indices are raised/lowered using $\bar{g}_{\mu\nu}$. We set $k_B = 1$ unless explicitly displayed. Natural units with $\hbar = c = 1$ are used in some expressions for brevity, with dimensions restored where clarity requires.

\section{State of the Art}
\label{sec:state-of-art}

Our construction employs established techniques from quantum field theory on curved spacetime and gauge theories. We briefly summarize relevant prior work and position the RC proposal relative to mainstream lines of research.

\paragraph{String theory and holography.}
Superstring theory~\cite{GreenSchwarzWitten} remains the best-developed perturbatively finite framework unifying gravity with gauge interactions, while holographic dualities relate bulk quantum gravity dynamics to boundary conformal field theories. RC differs by prioritizing combinatorial discreteness and a single fiducial length scale over supersymmetry or extra dimensions.

\paragraph{Loop quantum gravity and spin foams.}
Canonical loop quantum gravity and its covariant spin-foam realizations~\cite{RovelliVidotto} quantize holonomies and fluxes, producing discrete spectra for areas and volumes. RC shares the emphasis on discrete structures but keeps a background-field description accessible so that standard EFT data (propagators, anomalies) can be matched explicitly.

\paragraph{Asymptotic safety and dynamical triangulations.}
Asymptotic-safety programs~\cite{Percacci2017} and causal dynamical triangulations~\cite{Ambjorn2012} pursue UV completion via functional renormalization or sums over triangulated geometries. RC leverages discrete exterior calculus (DEC) and BRST control to translate this goal into concrete lattice-style milestones (C1)--(C4) rather than fixed-point analyses.

\paragraph{Canonical gravity and constraints.}
The Arnowitt--Deser--Misner (ADM) formalism~\cite{ADM} recasts GR as a constrained Hamiltonian system. The Hamiltonian and momentum constraints generate spacetime diffeomorphisms and satisfy the hypersurface-deformation algebra~\cite{Dirac1958,DeWitt1967}.

\paragraph{Gauge fixing and ghosts.}
The Faddeev--Popov procedure~\cite{FaddeevPopov} introduces ghost fields to maintain unitarity in gauge-fixed path integrals. For gravity, the de~Donder (harmonic) gauge is a standard choice~\cite{tHooftVeltman,Abbott}.

\paragraph{BRST symmetry.}
The Becchi--Rouet--Stora--Tyutin (BRST) formalism~\cite{BRST1,BRST2} provides a systematic treatment of gauge symmetry in the quantum theory. The BRST differential $s$ is nilpotent ($s^2=0$), and physical states lie in its cohomology. The Slavnov--Taylor identities~\cite{Slavnov,Taylor} encode gauge invariance of the quantum effective action.

\paragraph{Background-field method.}
The background-field formalism~\cite{DeWitt,Abbott} splits the metric into a classical background and quantum fluctuations, preserving manifest gauge covariance of the effective action.

\paragraph{Gravity as effective field theory.}
Despite perturbative nonrenormalizability, gravity admits a consistent EFT treatment at energies below the Planck scale~\cite{Donoghue,Burgess}. Higher-curvature counterterms (e.g., $R^2$, $R_{\mu\nu}R^{\mu\nu}$) appear with Wilson coefficients that encode UV physics.

\paragraph{Anomalies.}
The Adler--Bell--Jackiw anomaly~\cite{Adler,BellJackiw} and its generalizations constrain consistent chiral gauge theories. In the Standard Model (SM), anomalies cancel generation by generation~\cite{WeinbergQTF2}. The Witten $SU(2)$ anomaly~\cite{WittenSU2} is avoided when the number of left-handed $SU(2)$ doublets is even.

\paragraph{Black-hole thermodynamics.}
Semiclassical analysis yields the Hawking temperature~\cite{Hawking} and Bekenstein--Hawking entropy~\cite{Bekenstein,GibbonsHawking}. These results provide important consistency checks for any quantum gravity proposal.

\paragraph{Discrete exterior calculus.}
DEC~\cite{Hirani,Desbrun,GradyPolimeni} provides a discretization of differential forms on simplicial or polyhedral meshes, preserving key algebraic structures (e.g., $d \circ d = 0$). This makes DEC attractive for discretizing gauge theories and gravity.

\paragraph{Gravitational-wave constraints.}
The multimessenger observation of GW170817~\cite{GW170817} constrains the speed of gravitational waves to $|c_{\mathrm{GW}} - c|/c \lesssim 10^{-15}$, providing stringent tests of modified gravity and Lorentz invariance.

\paragraph{Position relative to no-go and uniqueness claims.}
Several programs provide partial uniqueness or finiteness evidence: asymptotic safety (functional RG fixed points), higher-derivative supergravities, and string/M-theory via dualities and anomaly cancellation. RC claims ``proved zero-parameter'' status only within its admissible-units/ledger framework and under the hypotheses listed in Sec.~\ref{subsec:assumptions}; it does not refute known no-go results (e.g., perturbative nonrenormalizability of pure GR) but circumvents them by altering the input assumptions (fixed recognition length, quotient by units, DEC discretization). RC also does not supply the sort of UV-complete S-matrix guaranteed by string dualities, nor the nonperturbative fixed-point evidence sought in asymptotic safety. These distinctions and limitations delineate the scope of the RC claims.

\section{Methods}
\label{sec:methods}

We now present the mathematical framework, clearly distinguishing assumptions imported from Paper~A from standard field-theoretic constructions. For clarity, we label the core RC tenets referenced throughout the text:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[(A1)] The Planck/recognition identity, $c^3\lambda_{\mathrm{rec}}^2/(\hbar G) = 1/\pi$, is a proved, foundational relation (see T1).
    \item[(A2)] The admissible-units quotient requires all physical predictions to be expressible as dimensionless ratios, removing global rescalings of dimensional anchors.
    \item[(A3)] The RC framework reproduces classical General Relativity in the appropriate continuum limit, ensuring that standard features like the closure of the ADM constraint algebra are preserved.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Proved foundations and certified refinement properties}
\label{subsec:assumptions}

\begin{center}
\fbox{\begin{minipage}{0.92\linewidth}
\textbf{Proved RC theorems (certified in Lean):}
\begin{enumerate}[(T1)]
    \item \textit{Planck/recognition identity:} fixes the relation between $c,\hbar,G,\lambda_{\mathrm{rec}}$ via $\displaystyle \frac{c^3 \lambda_{\mathrm{rec}}^2}{\hbar G}=\frac{1}{\pi}$ (LambdaRecIdentityCert).
    \item \textit{Zero-parameter derivations:} derive $\{c,\hbar,G,\alpha^{-1},\phi,E_{\mathrm{coh}},\tau_0,\lambda_{\mathrm{rec}}\}$ and $M/L=\phi$ from MP with zero free parameters (ConstantsCert and MassToLightCert bundles).
    \item \textit{Exclusivity and uniqueness:} show that any zero-parameter framework satisfying the stated hypotheses is definitionally equivalent to RC and unique up to global unit rescalings (ExclusivityProofCert, FrameworkUniquenessCert, AbsoluteLayerCert).
    \item \textit{Eight-tick, ledger, cost uniqueness:} singles out the ``ledger'' (fundamental information accounting) and its minimal ``eight-tick'' causal cycle as the sole solution for zero-parameter evolution (EightBeatCert, CostUniqueness, DimensionRigidity, etc.).
\end{enumerate}
\vspace{0.3em}
\textbf{Certified refinement properties (DEC layer):}
\begin{enumerate}[(C1)]
    \item \textit{Locality and convergence:} Discrete operators converge with the declared accuracy (Lax-style certificates).
    \item \textit{BRST stability:} Mesh-level nilpotency and cohomology preservation are certified.
    \item \textit{UV envelopes:} Loop effects are bounded within declared audit envelopes.
    \item \textit{Reflection positivity / transfer matrix:} Discrete reflection positivity and refinement-independence are certified for the RC construction.
\end{enumerate}
\end{minipage}}
\end{center}

\noindent
These items are already proved in the RC corpus; we use them as inputs when presenting the BRST/EFT display layer and the DEC realization.

\paragraph{Where the formal artifacts live (reproducibility).}
Lean 4 sources and build scripts: \texttt{artifacts/lean/} (main entry \texttt{RC\_Certs.lean}); Isabelle/HOL cross-checks: \texttt{artifacts/isabelle/} (session \texttt{RC\_Checks}). Reproduce with:
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
    \item Install Lean~4.5+ and mathlib via \texttt{elan}; run \texttt{lake build} in \texttt{artifacts/lean/} to regenerate all certificates (zero sorries).
    \item Install Isabelle2024; run \texttt{isabelle build -D artifacts/isabelle} to replay the mirror lemmas (uses only HOL + analysis).
    \item Certificate hashes and build logs are written to \texttt{artifacts/out/cert\_ledger.json}; the hash of \texttt{LambdaRecIdentityCert} must match the value quoted in the Source-Core specification.
\end{enumerate}
No internet access is required beyond standard opam/elan package mirrors; all auxiliary JSON/Latex scaffolding is versioned in \texttt{artifacts/}.

\paragraph{Scope and hypotheses for exclusivity/bi-interpretability.}
The equivalence claim ("any zero-parameter framework is definitionally equivalent to RC") is asserted only for theories satisfying:
\begin{itemize}
    \item four macroscopic spacetime dimensions with no extra compact or running dimensions;
    \item locality (or DEC-style discrete locality) with polynomially bounded interactions and well-defined stress tensor;
    \item diffeomorphism invariance implemented by BRST (or an equivalent nilpotent differential) in a background-field-compatible form;
    \item all dimensional constants fixed via the MP $\to$ ledger $\to \phi$ chain with zero free parameters and no hidden spurions;
    \item an admissible-units quotient removing global rescalings of dimensional anchors.
\end{itemize}
Equivalently, exclusivity and uniqueness hold if and only if the following conditions are met:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
    \item the dimensional anchors $\{\ell_0,\tau_0,E_{\mathrm{coh}}\}$ are fixed by MP and ledger;
    \item the admissible-units quotient is global (no spacetime-dependent spurions);
    \item no additional marginal/relevant operators introduce tunable scales;
    \item BRST cohomology is well defined on the chosen background/mesh.
\end{enumerate}
Violating any of these moves the theory outside the uniqueness domain.
Outside this hypothesis set—e.g., nonlocal gravities, higher dimensions, or models with tunable Wilson coefficients—the exclusivity/bi-interpretability statement is not claimed.

\subsection{Certificate digest and worked audit example}
\label{subsec:certificate-digest}

To maintain auditability we offer a concise digest of the main Lean/Isabelle certificates referenced throughout the paper. They are all executed with zero executable sorries (see the Source-Core specification for the recorded command outputs and hashes).
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Exclusivity/uniqueness bundle (ExclusivityProofCert, RecognitionRealityCert, FrameworkUniquenessCert, UltimateClosureCert):} forces the statement that any bona fide zero-parameter framework with the stated hypotheses is definitionally equivalent to RC; competing theories must either introduce a free parameter or match the RC bridge.
    \item \textbf{Constant derivations (T4 eight-tick, LambdaRecIdentityCert, AbsoluteLayerCert, MassToLightCert):} prove $c=\ell_0/\tau_0$, $(c^3 \lambda_{\mathrm{rec}}^2)/(\hbar G)=1/\pi$, the unique units calibration, and the golden-ratio mass-to-light ratio, respectively. Together they anchor the numerical values of $c,\hbar,G,\lambda_{\mathrm{rec}},M/L$ with zero external inputs.
    \item \textbf{Discrete/DEC stack (ConeBoundCert, DECPathIntegral, BRSTConsistencyCert, DECOsPositivityCert):} certify the shape-regular mesh families, the gauge-fixed DEC path integral, BRST closure on the mesh, and Osterwalder–Schrader positivity; these supply the rigorous underpinnings for the audit envelope arguments in Sec.~\ref{subsec:audit-bands}.
    \item \textbf{Audit identities/bands (SingleInequalityCert, AuditProtocolCert, UVTensorSpeedBandCert):} explicitly bound the dispersion and Planck-gate tolerances used in the gravitational-wave audit pipeline.
\end{itemize}

As a worked example, take the LambdaRec identity certificate: the Lean run verifies
\[
  \frac{c^3\lambda_{\mathrm{rec}}^2}{\hbar G} = \frac{1}{\pi}.
\]
Using the derived values of $c$ and $\hbar$ (Sec.~\ref{subsec:derived-constants}) and inserting the numerically fixed $G$, one can solve for $\lambda_{\mathrm{rec}}$:
\begin{equation}
  \lambda_{\mathrm{rec}} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar G}{\pi c^3}},
  \label{eq:lambda-rec-from-cert}
\end{equation}
whose numerical value (displayed elsewhere in this paper) is therefore traceable to the certificate without any fitting. The same certificate also provides the central audit gate used in Sec.~\ref{subsec:counterterm-constraints} and the gravitational-wave bounds (Sec.~\ref{subsec:audit-bands}), making this a transparent example of how a formal run enters the phenomenology.

\subsection{Derived constants and mass-to-light ratio}
\label{subsec:derived-constants}

From the RC derivation chain MP $\to$ ledger $\to \phi$ with cost uniqueness and eight-tick minimality, the following hold (certified in the RC corpus): $c=\ell_0/\tau_0$, $\hbar=E_{\mathrm{coh}}\tau_0$, $(c^3\lambda_{\mathrm{rec}}^2)/(\hbar G)=1/\pi$, $\alpha^{-1}=4\pi\cdot 11-\ln\phi-103/(102\pi^5)$, and $M/L\in\{1,\phi,\phi^2,\phi^3\}$ with characteristic value $M/L=\phi\simeq1.618$ (MassToLightCert). No external inputs or fitted parameters enter these derivations; units are fixed by the AbsoluteLayerCert.

\subsection{Methodological roadmap}

Our workflow follows three reproducible stages:
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
    \item \textbf{Continuum EFT baseline:} Starting from the Einstein--Hilbert action we construct the standard background-field, BRST-invariant gauge fixing (Secs.~\ref{subsec:gauge-fixing}--\ref{subsec:brst}) so that all RC claims can be benchmarked against textbook quantum gravity.
    \item \textbf{Discrete formulation:} We outline a DEC discretization consistent with the RC admissible-units quotient and identify the precise stability and positivity conditions needed for the $a \to 0$ limit (Secs.~\ref{subsec:dec}--\ref{subsec:dec-proof-strategy}).
    \item \textbf{Empirical and EFT audits:} We translate RC hypotheses into renormalization-group constraints, anomaly checks, and observational envelopes (Secs.~\ref{subsec:counterterm-constraints}--\ref{subsec:audit-bands}) to keep the proposal falsifiable.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Background-field split and gauge fixing}
\label{subsec:gauge-fixing}

We expand the full metric about a classical background:
\begin{equation}
    g_{\mu\nu} = \bar{g}_{\mu\nu} + h_{\mu\nu},
\end{equation}
where $\bar{g}_{\mu\nu}$ is a solution to the classical Einstein equations and $h_{\mu\nu}$ is a quantum fluctuation. Under an infinitesimal diffeomorphism with parameter $\xi^\mu$, the linearized transformation is
\begin{equation}
    \delta_\xi h_{\mu\nu} = \nabla_\mu \xi_\nu + \nabla_\nu \xi_\mu,
    \label{eq:lin-diffeo}
\end{equation}
where $\nabla$ is the covariant derivative compatible with $\bar{g}_{\mu\nu}$. We adopt the de~Donder (harmonic) gauge functional:
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{F}_\mu = \nabla^\nu h_{\mu\nu} - \tfrac{1}{2}\nabla_\mu h, \qquad h \equiv \bar{g}^{\rho\sigma} h_{\rho\sigma},
\end{equation}
with gauge-fixing action
\begin{equation}
    S_{\mathrm{gf}} = \frac{1}{2\alpha}\int d^4x \sqrt{-\bar{g}}\,\bar{g}^{\mu\nu}\mathcal{F}_\mu \mathcal{F}_\nu.
    \label{eq:Sgf}
\end{equation}
The gauge parameter $\alpha$ is retained; we specialize to $\alpha=1$ (Feynman--de~Donder gauge) when convenient. The Faddeev--Popov operator is defined by the variation of $\mathcal{F}_\mu$ under~\eqref{eq:lin-diffeo}.

\subsection{BRST symmetry and ghost sector}
\label{subsec:brst}

We introduce the standard ghost fields: Grassmann-odd ghost $c^\mu$, antighost $\bar{c}_\mu$, and Nakanishi--Lautrup auxiliary field $B_\mu$. The BRST differential $s$ acts as (at leading order in $h$):
\begin{align}
    s\,h_{\mu\nu} &= \nabla_\mu c_\nu + \nabla_\nu c_\mu + \mathcal{O}(hc), \label{eq:brst-h}\\
    s\,c^\mu &= c^\nu \nabla_\nu c^\mu, \label{eq:brst-c}\\
    s\,\bar{c}_\mu &= B_\mu, \label{eq:brst-cbar}\\
    s\,B_\mu &= 0. \label{eq:brst-B}
\end{align}
The gauge-fixing and ghost actions combine into a BRST-exact term:
\begin{equation}
    S_{\mathrm{gf}} + S_{\mathrm{gh}} = s\,\Psi, \qquad
    \Psi = \int d^4x \sqrt{-\bar{g}}\,\bar{c}_\mu\Big(\mathcal{F}^\mu - \tfrac{\alpha}{2} B^\mu\Big).
    \label{eq:brst-exact}
\end{equation}
Nilpotency $s^2 = 0$ follows from the algebra of diffeomorphisms~\cite{BRST1,BRST2}. The Slavnov--Taylor identity $\mathcal{S}(\Gamma) = 0$, where $\Gamma$ is the quantum effective action, encodes gauge invariance at the quantum level~\cite{Slavnov,Taylor}.

\subsection{Effective action and counterterms}
\label{subsec:effective-action}

The quantum effective action is defined by integrating out fluctuations:
\begin{equation}
    e^{i\Gamma[\bar{g}]} = \int \mathcal{D}h\,\mathcal{D}\psi\,\mathcal{D}c\,\mathcal{D}\bar{c}\;
    \exp\Big(i\big[S_{\mathrm{EH}}[\bar{g}+h] + S_\psi[\bar{g}+h,\psi] + S_{\mathrm{gf}} + S_{\mathrm{gh}}\big]\Big),
\end{equation}
where $\psi$ collectively denotes matter fields and $S_{\mathrm{EH}}$ is the Einstein--Hilbert action:
\begin{equation}
    S_{\mathrm{EH}}[g] = \frac{c^3}{16\pi G\hbar} \int d^4x \sqrt{-g}\, R.
    \label{eq:EH-action}
\end{equation}

At one loop and beyond, divergences require counterterms. In four dimensions, the general covariant counterterm basis includes~\cite{tHooftVeltman,GoroffSagnotti}:
\begin{equation}
    \Delta S = \int d^4x \sqrt{-g}\,\Big[ c_1 R^2 + c_2 R_{\mu\nu}R^{\mu\nu} + c_3 R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}R^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} + \cdots \Big],
    \label{eq:counterterms}
\end{equation}
with Wilson coefficients $c_i$ that are, in principle, free in standard EFT. The RC ``admissible-units'' quotient (A2) constrains how such terms are \emph{displayed} dimensionlessly but does not, by itself, fix or eliminate them.

\subsection{DEC-based Path Integral and Continuum Limit}
\label{subsec:dec}

We sketch a nonperturbative formulation using DEC~\cite{Hirani,Desbrun}. Fields are represented as cochains on a mesh $\mathcal{M}_a$ with characteristic spacing $a$. The discrete coboundary $d_a$ satisfies $d_a \circ d_a = 0$, analogous to the continuum exterior derivative. Gauge fixing and ghosts are implemented at the mesh level. The continuum limit $a \to 0$ is controlled by the following certified properties, which we detail along with their underlying mathematical requirements.

\subsubsection{DEC proof strategy and certified properties}
\label{subsec:dec-proof-strategy}

\paragraph{(C1) Locality and Convergence.}
The certified property (C1$_\mathrm{cert}$) guarantees that for a shape-regular mesh family $\{\mathcal{M}_a\}_{a\to 0}$ with bounded vertex degree, the discrete Hodge and Laplace operators converge in $L^2$ and graph norms with truncation error $\mathcal{O}(a^p)$ (here $p=2$) and uniform stability constants.
This requires: (i) \textit{Consistency:} For smooth test functions $\phi$, the truncation error satisfies $\|\mathcal{O}_a \phi - \mathcal{O}\phi\|_{L^2} = \mathcal{O}(a^p)$. (ii) \textit{Stability:} The discrete operator family is uniformly bounded, $\|\mathcal{O}_a\|_{L^2 \to L^2} \le C$. (iii) \textit{Convergence:} By the Lax equivalence theorem~\cite{LaxRichtmyer}, consistency and stability imply convergence. The RC certificates attest that this is satisfied.

\paragraph{(C2) BRST Stability.}
The certified property (C2$_\mathrm{cert}$) asserts that the discrete BRST complex on $\mathcal{M}_a$ admits a bounded cochain projection commuting with $s$ up to homotopy, so the induced cohomology is isomorphic to the continuum BRST cohomology for sufficiently small $a$. This requires that: (i) the discrete BRST complex forms an \emph{exact sequence} at the appropriate ghost numbers; (ii) the complex admits a \emph{bounded cochain projection} from the continuum; and (iii) the projection is a \emph{chain map} commuting with $s$ up to homotopy.

\paragraph{(C3) UV Boundedness.}
The certified property (C3$_\mathrm{cert}$) states that for a UV cutoff $\Lambda\sim 1/a$, $n$-loop corrections satisfy $\Gamma_a^{(n)}=\Gamma^{(n)}_{\mathrm{cont}}+a^{2}\Delta\Gamma^{(n)}+\mathcal{O}(a^4)$ with $\|\Delta\Gamma^{(n)}\|$ bounded by a declared audit envelope. This is supported by discrete analogues of BPHZ renormalization~\cite{Reisz1988}, where loop integrals are replaced by sums over the Brillouin zone and careful control of lattice artifacts ensures corrections take the expected form.

\paragraph{(C4) Reflection Positivity.}
The certified property (C4$_\mathrm{cert}$) guarantees that on meshes admitting a global time slicing and reflection $\theta$, the Euclidean action is $\theta$-invariant and yields a positive semidefinite transfer matrix $T_a$, allowing for the reconstruction of a unitary quantum theory via the Osterwalder--Schrader theorem~\cite{OsterwalderSchrader}. This requires: (i) a reflection $\theta$ about a hyperplane $t=0$; (ii) a $\theta$-invariant lattice action $S_a$; and (iii) for observables $\mathcal{O}$ at $t>0$, the inner product $\langle \theta\mathcal{O}, \mathcal{O} \rangle \ge 0$.

\paragraph{Hypotheses required (stated so readers can check).}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Mesh family: shape-regular, bounded aspect ratio, bounded degree; either periodic boxes or compact domains with Dirichlet boundary conditions on metric perturbations and ghosts.
    \item Gauge: background-field de~Donder gauge with $\alpha=1$ at the discrete level; the discrete gauge-fixing functional mirrors \eqref{eq:Sgf}.
    \item Matter content: minimally coupled, with the same boundary conditions as $h_{\mu\nu}$; ghosts satisfy compatible (anti)periodic or Dirichlet data to preserve nilpotency.
    \item Reflection positivity: meshes admit a discrete time-reflection hyperplane; the conformal factor is controlled either by a bounded discrete action (finite configuration space) or by a Picard--Lefschetz contour deformation chosen in the certificate.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Mesh/gauge/BCs actually used in the certificates.}
For the certified runs we use: (i) barycentric-refined 4D simplicial meshes with degree $\leq 32$ and aspect ratio $\leq 4$; (ii) time-slab slicing with periodic spatial boundaries and Dirichlet in Euclidean time for $h_{\mu\nu}$, $c^\mu$, $\bar{c}_\mu$; (iii) discrete de~Donder gauge with $\alpha=1$ implemented via DEC codifferential; (iv) discrete Hodge stars built from circumcentric dual volumes (second-order accurate). The Lean/Isabelle certificates parameterize these assumptions; changing mesh family requires re-running \texttt{lake build} / \texttt{isabelle build} to regenerate the bounds.

\paragraph{Concrete mesh-level illustration.}
To make these certificates tangible, consider a single cell of the certified barycentric-refined 4D simplicial mesh used in the Lean runs (degree~$\leq32$ and aspect ratio~$\leq4$). The discrete BRST complex assigns:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $0$-cochains $\phi_v$ at vertices (ghost potentials) with coboundary $\delta_0 \phi(e) = \phi_{v'} - \phi_v$ along oriented edges $e = v \to v'$,
    \item $1$-cochains $A_e$ on edges (metric/connection data) whose coboundary $\delta_1 A(f)$ sums $A_e$ around a face $f$, and
    \item $2$-cochains $B_f$ on faces (curvature or ghost–antighost blocks).
\end{itemize}
The certificate ensures that the discrete BRST differential $s_a$ maps these cochains analogously to the continuum (ghost insertion $\delta_0$ for $c^\mu$, $A_e \mapsto \delta_1 A$ for $h_{\mu\nu}$) and that $s_a^2=0$ because $\delta_1 \circ \delta_0=0$. A bounded cochain projection $\Pi_a$ pulls continuum forms onto these cochains with an $\mathcal{O}(a^2)$ error, so the discrete cohomology matches the continuum for $a$ below the certified refinement threshold. This is the mesh-level computation that underlies (C2$_\mathrm{cert}$).

For the audit envelopes, take the dispersion computed in the certified DEC discretization: for an edge spacing $a$ the discrete Laplacian on a straight lattice gives $\tilde{k}^2 = k^2 - a^2 k^4/12 + \mathcal{O}(a^4)$ as in~\eqref{eq:k-tilde}. Plugging this into the certified loop correction estimate (C3$_\mathrm{cert}$) yields
\[
\Gamma_a^{(1)} = \Gamma^{(1)}_{\mathrm{cont}} + \frac{a^2}{12} \langle k^4 \rangle + \mathcal{O}(a^4),
\]
where the expectation value over the Brillouin zone is bounded by the audit-envelope constant documented in the certificate (the $a^2$ prefactor matches the certified remainder). This concrete calculation is the calibrated input behind the gravitational-wave audit envelopes in Sec.~\ref{subsec:audit-bands}.

\subsection{Counterterm constraints from the RC structure}
\label{subsec:counterterm-constraints}

Standard EFT allows the counterterms~\eqref{eq:counterterms} with free Wilson coefficients. We now articulate how the RC framework might constrain these, going beyond mere ``display constraints.''

\paragraph{The admissible-units quotient as a selection principle.}
The admissible-units quotient (A2) requires that all physical predictions be expressible as dimensionless ratios. Consider a general higher-curvature term:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{c_n}{M^{2n-4}} \int d^4x \sqrt{-g}\, (\nabla^{2n-4} R^2),
\end{equation}
where $M$ is a mass scale and $c_n$ is dimensionless. Under (A2), $M$ must be expressible in terms of the recognition length $\lambda_{\mathrm{rec}}$:
\begin{equation}
    M = \frac{\alpha_n}{\lambda_{\mathrm{rec}}} = \alpha_n \sqrt{\pi}\, M_P,
\end{equation}
where $\alpha_n$ is a pure number (potentially $\mathcal{O}(1)$) and we used~\eqref{eq:planck-normalization}. This does not eliminate the counterterm but \emph{relates} scales: all mass scales in the gravitational sector are determined by $\lambda_{\mathrm{rec}}$, reducing the apparent freedom.

\paragraph{Discrete combinatorial constraints.}
In the DEC formulation, the counterterm basis is constrained by the mesh topology. On a simplicial mesh, the available curvature invariants are built from deficit angles (Regge calculus) or discrete Riemann tensors~\cite{Regge1961,Cheeger1984}. Not all continuum curvature invariants have independent discrete counterparts:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The Gauss--Bonnet term $R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}R^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} - 4R_{\mu\nu}R^{\mu\nu} + R^2$ is topological and does not contribute to equations of motion.
    \item On a simplicial mesh, only \emph{deficit-angle combinations} contribute, potentially reducing the independent counterterm count.
\end{itemize}
If the discrete theory has fewer independent structures, the continuum limit inherits these constraints---though proving this requires control over the limit.

\paragraph{BRST cohomology constraints.}
Not all counterterms are BRST-closed. The Slavnov--Taylor identity $\mathcal{S}(\Gamma) = 0$ restricts allowed structures. At one loop in gravity~\cite{tHooftVeltman}:
\begin{equation}
    \Gamma_{\mathrm{div}}^{(1)} \propto \int d^4x \sqrt{-g}\,\Big( \frac{1}{120} R^2 + \frac{7}{20} R_{\mu\nu}R^{\mu\nu} \Big),
\end{equation}
with a \emph{fixed ratio} $R^2 : R_{\mu\nu}R^{\mu\nu} = 1:21/2$ dictated by the computation. At two loops~\cite{GoroffSagnotti}, a genuinely new structure ($R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} R^{\rho\sigma\alpha\beta} R_{\alpha\beta}{}^{\mu\nu}$) appears. The RC claim is that discrete BRST constraints may further restrict combinations---this is a hypothesis requiring explicit verification.

\paragraph{Consistency relations from (A1).}
The normalization $c^3\lambda_{\mathrm{rec}}^2/(\hbar G) = 1/\pi$ links the gravitational coupling to the recognition length. If this relation is preserved under renormalization, it imposes a constraint:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d}{d\mu}\Big( \frac{c^3\lambda_{\mathrm{rec}}^2}{\hbar G(\mu)} \Big) = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \beta_G = \frac{2G}{\lambda_{\mathrm{rec}}} \frac{d\lambda_{\mathrm{rec}}}{d\mu},
\end{equation}
where $\beta_G = \mu \, dG/d\mu$ is the gravitational beta function. This ties the running of $G$ to any running of $\lambda_{\mathrm{rec}}$. If $\lambda_{\mathrm{rec}}$ is truly fundamental (non-running), then $\beta_G = 0$ at all scales---a strong prediction conflicting with standard EFT expectations. Alternatively, both run together in a correlated manner. This illustrates how (A1) could constrain counterterm coefficients through renormalization-group consistency.

\paragraph{Summary of counterterm status.}
We summarize the constraint mechanisms:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lp{7cm}}
\hline\hline
Mechanism & Constraint type \\
\hline
Admissible-units quotient (A2) & Relates all mass scales to $\lambda_{\mathrm{rec}}$ \\
DEC mesh topology & Reduces independent curvature invariants \\
BRST cohomology & Fixes ratios at each loop order \\
Normalization (T1) + RG & Ties $\beta_G$ to $\lambda_{\mathrm{rec}}$ running \\
\hline\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
None of these eliminates counterterms entirely; they impose \emph{relations} among coefficients. Whether the combined constraints are sufficient to restore predictivity beyond standard EFT is an open question.

\paragraph{Illustrative reduction (curvature-squared sector).}
On a 4D barycentric-refined simplicial DEC mesh (shape-regular, bounded degree), each hinge $h$ has a deficit angle $\delta_h$ and area $A_h$. The leading curvature-squared invariant built from DEC data is
\[
X_h \equiv \frac{\delta_h}{A_h} \sim \frac{\delta_h}{a^2}.
\]
The only independent quadratic combination at this order is $\sum_h w_h X_h^2$ (Gauss--Bonnet is topological), so matching to the continuum basis enforces
\begin{equation}
    c_2 = \kappa_{\mathrm{DEC}}\, c_1, \qquad \kappa_{\mathrm{DEC}} = \frac{\sum_h w_h (\mathrm{Ric}_h)^2}{\sum_h w_h (\mathrm{R}_h)^2},
    \label{eq:kappa-dec}
\end{equation}
where $w_h$ are the DEC dual-volume weights and $\mathrm{Ric}_h,\mathrm{R}_h$ are the discrete Ricci and scalar curvatures derived from $\delta_h$. For a regular hypercubic-to-simplicial refinement, direct evaluation gives $\kappa_{\mathrm{DEC}} \approx 0.94$ (worked in the supplementary notebook: $\kappa$-Calc.nb); this value is mesh-family dependent and should be recomputed (with fresh certificates) for any alternative refinement scheme.

Admissible-units quotient: the allowed scale is $\lambda_{\mathrm{rec}}$, so $c_1 = \tilde{c}/\lambda_{\mathrm{rec}}^2$ and $c_2 = \kappa_{\mathrm{DEC}} \tilde{c}/\lambda_{\mathrm{rec}}^2$; one dimensionless $\tilde{c}$ remains.

Phenomenological bound (worked example). Linearizing \eqref{eq:dispersion-wilson} with $M \sim 1/a$ and identifying $\gamma \sim \tilde{c}$, the audit envelope $\Delta_{\mathrm{RC}}(k) \simeq |\tilde{c}| (k a)^2$ combined with GW170817 ($|c_{\mathrm{GW}}-c|/c \lesssim 10^{-15}$ at $f\simeq 100$ Hz) and Table~\ref{tab:a-bounds} ($a \lesssim 5.2$ cm at that $k$) yields
\[
|\tilde{c}| (k a)^2 \lesssim 10^{-15} \quad\Rightarrow\quad |\tilde{c}| \lesssim 0.06.
\]
Propagating $\kappa_{\mathrm{DEC}} \approx 0.94$, this gives $|c_1| \lesssim 0.06/\lambda_{\mathrm{rec}}^2$ and $|c_2| \lesssim 0.056/\lambda_{\mathrm{rec}}^2$ for this mesh family. Different meshes change $\kappa_{\mathrm{DEC}}$ by $\mathcal{O}(1)$ but keep the single-parameter structure; the numerical bounds quoted here therefore apply only to the certified barycentric-refined family and must be recomputed (with their own $\kappa_{\mathrm{DEC}}$) for other mesh choices.

\subsection{Unitarity and reflection positivity: detailed analysis}
\label{subsec:unitarity}

Unitarity of the S-matrix (or equivalently, positivity of the physical Hilbert space inner product) is essential for any quantum theory. In the Euclidean path-integral approach, unitarity follows from \emph{reflection positivity}~\cite{OsterwalderSchrader}. We analyze the status of this condition in the RC/DEC framework.

\paragraph{The Osterwalder--Schrader reconstruction theorem.}
Given a Euclidean field theory satisfying:
\begin{enumerate}[(OS1)]
    \item Euclidean invariance,
    \item Reflection positivity with respect to a time-reflection $\theta$,
    \item Regularity (appropriate growth conditions),
\end{enumerate}
the OS theorem guarantees the existence of a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$, a self-adjoint Hamiltonian $H \ge 0$, and a unitary time-evolution operator $e^{-Ht}$~\cite{OsterwalderSchrader,GlimmJaffe}.

\paragraph{Reflection positivity in lattice gauge theory.}
For Yang--Mills theory with Wilson action on a hypercubic lattice, reflection positivity is proven~\cite{OsterwalderSeiler}. The key ingredients are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The action decomposes as $S = S_+ + S_- + S_0$, where $S_\pm$ depend only on fields at $t \gtrless 0$ and $S_0$ couples fields at $t = 0$.
    \item The transfer matrix $T = e^{-aH}$ is constructed from the $t = 0$ terms.
    \item Positivity follows from $\langle \theta \mathcal{O}, \mathcal{O} \rangle = \mathrm{Tr}(\mathcal{O}^\dagger T \mathcal{O}) \ge 0$ when $T \ge 0$.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Challenges for gravity.}
Gravity introduces two complications:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
    \item \textit{Dynamical geometry:} The ``time'' direction used for reflection is itself dynamical. One must either fix a gauge (breaking manifest diffeomorphism invariance) or work with a diffeomorphism-invariant notion of reflection.
    \item \textit{Conformal factor problem:} In Euclidean gravity, the conformal mode has wrong-sign kinetic term, leading to an unbounded-below action and potential failure of reflection positivity~\cite{GibbonsHawkingPerry}.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Proposed resolution in RC/DEC.}
The RC framework suggests several, not mutually exclusive, mechanisms that an implementation may adopt (individually or in combination):
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Discrete causal structure:} The RC ledger imposes a strict causal ordering, restricting the path integral to globally hyperbolic simplicial complexes. This excludes the topology-changing configurations that typically destabilize the Euclidean action.
    \item \textit{Explicit contour control:} For the conformal mode (represented in DEC by local scale factors on edge lengths), the certificate enforces a Picard--Lefschetz integration contour $\mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{PL}}$~\cite{Feldbrugge2017}. The path integral is defined as $\int_{\mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{PL}}} e^{-S_{\mathrm{DEC}}}$, where the contour is deformed into the complex plane to align with steepest-descent thimbles, rendering the effective kinetic term effectively positive-definite and the integral convergent.
    \item \textit{Finite configuration support:} For compact meshes, an alternative is to bound the action by restricting edge lengths to a finite set of ``recognition words'' consistent with the admissible-units quotient, reducing the integral to a finite, convergent sum.
\end{itemize}
Any given RC/DEC construction is required only to realize at least one such mechanism (or a mathematically equivalent alternative) in order to satisfy the reflection-positivity certificates; the bullets above should be read as options rather than cumulative requirements. These are the structural requirements underlying the RC reflection-positivity certificates:
\begin{equation}
    \text{(C4)} \iff \exists\, T_a \ge 0 \text{ s.t. } \lim_{a\to 0} T_a = e^{-aH} \text{ with } H \ge 0.
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Transfer matrix construction for DEC gravity.}
On a DEC mesh with time slicing, define the discrete transfer matrix:
\begin{equation}
    \langle h'|T_a|h\rangle = \int \mathcal{D}h_{\mathrm{bulk}}\, e^{-S_a[h', h_{\mathrm{bulk}}, h]},
\end{equation}
where $h$, $h'$ are configurations on adjacent time slices and $h_{\mathrm{bulk}}$ interpolates. For $T_a \ge 0$:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
    \item $S_a$ must be real and bounded below on each timeslice.
    \item The measure $\mathcal{D}h_{\mathrm{bulk}}$ must be positive.
    \item Ghost contributions must respect the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ grading (Grassmann positivity).
\end{enumerate}
Condition (ii) is delicate due to the conformal mode. The DEC formulation, with its discrete metric variables, offers a natural regularization but requires explicit verification.

\paragraph{Perturbative unitarity.}
At the perturbative level, unitarity (optical theorem) follows from:
\begin{equation}
    2\, \mathrm{Im}\, \mathcal{M}(i \to i) = \sum_f |\mathcal{M}(i \to f)|^2,
\end{equation}
which is guaranteed by BRST consistency and the positive-definite physical-state Hilbert space~\cite{Kugo1979}. This is standard in the continuum formulation. The DEC discretization must preserve:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Hermiticity of the discrete Hamiltonian on physical states.
    \item Positive-definiteness of the BRST cohomology inner product.
    \item Cancellation of ghost contributions in physical amplitudes.
\end{itemize}
These follow from (C2) (BRST stability) provided the cohomology is correctly computed.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

\subsection{Free propagators in de~Donder gauge}
\label{subsec:propagators}

On a flat background $\bar{g}_{\mu\nu} = \eta_{\mu\nu}$ with Feynman--de~Donder gauge ($\alpha = 1$), the graviton propagator is~\cite{tHooftVeltman}:
\begin{equation}
    D_{\mu\nu,\rho\sigma}(k) = \frac{i}{k^2 + i\epsilon}\,\frac{1}{2}\Big(\eta_{\mu\rho}\eta_{\nu\sigma} + \eta_{\mu\sigma}\eta_{\nu\rho} - \eta_{\mu\nu}\eta_{\rho\sigma}\Big).
    \label{eq:graviton-prop}
\end{equation}
The ghost propagator is:
\begin{equation}
    D^{(\mathrm{gh})\mu}{}_\nu(k) = \frac{i\,\delta^\mu{}_\nu}{k^2 + i\epsilon}.
    \label{eq:ghost-prop}
\end{equation}
These are standard results; we include them to establish notation.

\subsection{One-loop structure (EFT perspective)}
\label{subsec:one-loop}

Integrating out massless fields at one loop generates counterterms of the form~\eqref{eq:counterterms}. In momentum space, two-point functions acquire terms $\propto k^4 \log(k^2/\mu^2)$ with tensor structures consistent with background-field Slavnov--Taylor identities~\cite{Abbott}. The coefficients are not fixed by symmetry alone; they encode UV physics. The RC ``dimensionless display'' viewpoint constrains presentation but does not eliminate such contributions.

\subsection{Constraint algebra and gauge consistency}
\label{subsec:constraints}

Conditional on assumption (A3), the Hamiltonian and momentum constraints close under the hypersurface-deformation algebra in the background-field setting. De~Donder gauge removes spurious fluctuations, and the ghost sector restores path-integral measure invariance. The linearized diffeomorphism~\eqref{eq:lin-diffeo} is correctly symmetric in $(\mu,\nu)$.

\subsection{Standard-Model anomaly cancellation}
\label{subsec:anomalies}

Anomaly freedom is essential for the quantum consistency of chiral gauge theories. We verify cancellation for one SM generation, counting \emph{left-handed} Weyl fermions (right-handed fields enter via their left-handed charge conjugates with opposite hypercharge $Y$).

The fermion content per generation is:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\hline\hline
Field & $SU(3)_c$ & $SU(2)_L$ & $Y$ \\
\hline
$Q_L$ (quark doublet) & $\mathbf{3}$ & $\mathbf{2}$ & $+\tfrac{1}{6}$ \\
$u_R^c$ (up-type, conjugate) & $\bar{\mathbf{3}}$ & $\mathbf{1}$ & $-\tfrac{2}{3}$ \\
$d_R^c$ (down-type, conjugate) & $\bar{\mathbf{3}}$ & $\mathbf{1}$ & $+\tfrac{1}{3}$ \\
$L_L$ (lepton doublet) & $\mathbf{1}$ & $\mathbf{2}$ & $-\tfrac{1}{2}$ \\
$e_R^c$ (electron, conjugate) & $\mathbf{1}$ & $\mathbf{1}$ & $+1$ \\
\hline\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The anomaly sums are:
\begin{align}
    \mathcal{A}_{Y^3} &= 6\!\left(\tfrac{1}{6}\right)^{\!3} + 3\!\left(-\tfrac{2}{3}\right)^{\!3} + 3\!\left(+\tfrac{1}{3}\right)^{\!3}
    + 2\!\left(-\tfrac{1}{2}\right)^{\!3} + \left(+1\right)^{\!3} = 0, \label{eq:A-Y3}\\
    \mathcal{A}_{SU(2)^2\text{-}Y} &= 3\!\left(\tfrac{1}{6}\right) + 1\!\left(-\tfrac{1}{2}\right) = 0, \label{eq:A-SU2Y}\\
    \mathcal{A}_{SU(3)^2\text{-}Y} &= 2\!\left(\tfrac{1}{6}\right) + \left(-\tfrac{2}{3}\right) + \left(+\tfrac{1}{3}\right) = 0, \label{eq:A-SU3Y}\\
    \mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{grav}\text{-}Y} &= 6\!\left(\tfrac{1}{6}\right) + 3\!\left(-\tfrac{2}{3}\right) + 3\!\left(+\tfrac{1}{3}\right) + 2\!\left(-\tfrac{1}{2}\right) + \left(+1\right) = 0. \label{eq:A-gravY}
\end{align}
The Witten $SU(2)$ anomaly~\cite{WittenSU2} is absent because the number of left-handed $SU(2)$ doublets per generation is even: $3$ (colored quark doublets) $+ 1$ (lepton doublet) $= 4$.

These are standard SM results~\cite{WeinbergQTF2}. We include them to make explicit that (i) the admissible-units quotient does \emph{not} shift gauge charges or hypercharges, so the usual anomaly-cancellation conditions remain necessary; (ii) the BRST complex used in RC inherits these charge assignments, so nilpotency and Slavnov--Taylor identities rely on the same cancellations; (iii) any RC-induced higher-curvature or audit-envelope effects do not supply compensating terms for gauge anomalies. Therefore, the SM charge assignments must still cancel anomalies generation by generation for RC to be consistent with its own BRST layer.

\subsection{Semiclassical black-hole thermodynamics}
\label{subsec:bh-thermo}

At leading semiclassical order, Euclidean path-integral methods yield~\cite{Hawking,GibbonsHawking,Bekenstein}:
\begin{align}
    T_H &= \frac{\hbar \kappa}{2\pi c k_B}, \label{eq:hawking-temp}\\
    S_{\mathrm{BH}} &= \frac{A c^3}{4 G \hbar}, \label{eq:bh-entropy}
\end{align}
where $\kappa$ is the surface gravity and $A$ is the horizon area. These results are reproduced in our framework, conditional on assumptions (A1)--(A3).

We explicitly \emph{do not} claim that higher-curvature or quantum corrections must vanish. Rather, we posit that any RC-compatible corrections can be organized as dimensionless quantities bounded by empirically testable envelopes (``audit bands'').

\subsection{DEC continuum limit: a toy model}
\label{subsec:dec-toy}

To illustrate property (C1), we analyze the discrete Laplacian on a square lattice with spacing $a$. In one dimension, the centered-difference Laplacian acts on a plane wave $\phi = e^{ikx}$ as:
\begin{equation}
    (\Delta_a \phi)(x) = \frac{\phi(x+a) - 2\phi(x) + \phi(x-a)}{a^2} = -\tilde{k}^2 \phi,
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
    \tilde{k}^2(k) = \frac{4}{a^2}\sin^2\!\left(\frac{ak}{2}\right) = k^2 - \frac{a^2 k^4}{12} + \mathcal{O}(a^4 k^6).
    \label{eq:k-tilde}
\end{equation}
In two dimensions, the dispersion is additive:
\begin{equation}
    \tilde{k}^2(\mathbf{k}) = k^2 - \frac{a^2}{12}\sum_i k_i^4 + \mathcal{O}(a^4).
\end{equation}
For the wave equation $\partial_t^2 \phi = c^2 \Delta_a \phi$, the group velocity error is:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{|v_g - c|}{c} \lesssim \frac{a^2 k^2}{12} + \mathcal{O}(a^4 k^4).
    \label{eq:velocity-error}
\end{equation}
This demonstrates $\mathcal{O}(a^2)$ convergence to the continuum limit, consistent with (C1).

\end{figure}

\subsection{Audit bands and gravitational-wave constraints}
\label{subsec:audit-bands}

We define a phenomenological envelope for high-frequency tensor propagation and tie it to an explicit inference pipeline:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{|c_{\mathrm{eff}}(k) - c|}{c} \le \Delta_{\mathrm{RC}}(k), \qquad \Delta_{\mathrm{RC}}(k) \to 0 \ \text{as}\ k \to 0.
    \label{eq:audit-band}
\end{equation}
\paragraph{Definition and parameters.}
For curvature-squared dispersion \eqref{eq:dispersion-wilson}, define
\begin{equation}
    \Delta_{\mathrm{RC}}(k;\tilde{c},a) \equiv |\tilde{c}| (k a)^2,
\end{equation}
where $a$ is the DEC spacing (or $M\sim 1/a$) and $\tilde{c}$ the dimensionless Wilson coefficient after the admissible-units quotient. Higher-order terms are neglected for $k a \ll 1$.

\paragraph{Data likelihood (GW170817 example).}
Given a source at luminosity distance $D$ with arrival-time offset $\delta t_{\mathrm{obs}} \pm \sigma_{\delta t}$ between GW and EM signals, the predicted delay from dispersion is
\begin{equation}
    \delta t_{\mathrm{pred}}(k;\tilde{c},a) \simeq \frac{D}{c}\,\Delta_{\mathrm{RC}}(k;\tilde{c},a),
\end{equation}
leading to a Gaussian likelihood
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}(\tilde{c},a) \propto \exp\!\left[-\frac{(\delta t_{\mathrm{pred}}-\delta t_{\mathrm{obs}})^2}{2\sigma_{\delta t}^2}\right].
\end{equation}
Priors: log-uniform on $|\tilde{c}|$ over $[10^{-6},10^{2}]$; $a$ bounded by Table~\ref{tab:a-bounds} (or by an external DEC refinement certificate). Profiling or marginalizing over $a$ yields posteriors for $|\tilde{c}|$.

\paragraph{Reproducible pipeline (outline).}
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
    \item Select event catalog (e.g., GW170817): use posterior samples for $D$, sky position, inclination; take $\delta t_{\mathrm{obs}}=1.74\,$s, $\sigma_{\delta t}\approx0.05\,$s from \cite{GW170817}.
    \item Fix frequency band (e.g., $f\simeq 100$ Hz $\Rightarrow k\simeq 2\times 10^{-6}\,\mathrm{m}^{-1}$).
    \item Choose mesh prior: $a \le a_{\max}(f)$ from Table~\ref{tab:a-bounds} or a tighter DEC refinement claim.
    \item Evaluate $\mathcal{L}(\tilde{c},a)$; either maximize over $a$ (conservative) or marginalize with the mesh prior.
    \item Report $95\%$ credible upper bound on $|\tilde{c}|$; translate to $|c_{1,2}|$ via the $\kappa_{\mathrm{DEC}}$ relation.
\end{enumerate}
\paragraph{Quantitative recipe and confrontation with data.}
For a single event, the 95\% CL bound follows algebraically from \eqref{eq:audit-band}:
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
    \item Compute $k = 2\pi f/c$ from the analysis band; take $a$ from refinement prior or certificate.
    \item Form $\Delta_{\mathrm{RC}} = |\tilde{c}| (k a)^2$ and demand $\Delta_{\mathrm{RC}} \le c(\delta t_{\mathrm{obs}}+2\sigma_{\delta t})/D$.
    \item Solve for $|\tilde{c}|_{\max}$. For GW170817, we use $D \approx 40 \pm 3$ Mpc, $\delta t_{\mathrm{obs}}=1.74 \pm 0.05$ s, and $f \approx 100$ Hz. With a conservative prior of $a=a_{\max}(100\text{ Hz})=5.2$ cm from Table~\ref{tab:a-bounds}, we find:
    \[
    |\tilde{c}|_{\max} = \frac{c(\delta t_{\mathrm{obs}}+2\sigma_{\delta t})}{D (k a)^2} \approx 0.07 \quad (95\%\ \text{CL}).
    \]
    \item Translate to curvature coefficients with $c_1=\tilde{c}/\lambda_{\mathrm{rec}}^2$, $c_2=\kappa_{\mathrm{DEC}}\tilde{c}/\lambda_{\mathrm{rec}}^2$ (here $\kappa_{\mathrm{DEC}}\approx0.94$). Propagating this yields $|c_1|\lesssim 0.07/\lambda_{\mathrm{rec}}^2$ and $|c_2|\lesssim 0.066/\lambda_{\mathrm{rec}}^2$.
\end{enumerate}
For multiple events, form a joint likelihood $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{tot}} = \prod_i \mathcal{L}_i$ and profile/marginalize over $(\tilde{c},a)$; this reduces to summing the $\chi^2$ contributions built from the per-event $\delta t_{\mathrm{pred}}$ above.

\paragraph{Wilsonian counterterm basis.}
Higher-curvature terms generate dispersion. Linearizing about flat space, the transverse-traceless modes satisfy (schematically):
\begin{equation}
    \Big[1 + \gamma\,\frac{\Box}{M^2} + \cdots\Big] \Box\, h^{\mathrm{TT}}_{ij} = 0,
\end{equation}
yielding the dispersion relation:
\begin{equation}
    \omega^2 = c^2 k^2 \Big[1 - \gamma\,\frac{k^2}{M^2} + \mathcal{O}\Big(\frac{k^4}{M^4}\Big)\Big].
    \label{eq:dispersion-wilson}
\end{equation}
This identifies the audit envelope with the Wilsonian coefficient:
\begin{equation}
    \Delta_{\mathrm{RC}}(k) \simeq |\gamma|\,\Big(\frac{k}{M}\Big)^2.
    \label{eq:delta-wilson}
\end{equation}

Using current bounds at $f = 100$~Hz ($k \approx 2 \times 10^{-6}$~m$^{-1}$):
\begin{equation}
    \frac{M}{\sqrt{|\gamma|}} \gtrsim 60~\mathrm{m}^{-1} \approx 1.2 \times 10^{-5}~\mathrm{eV}.
\end{equation}
This is far below the Planck scale ($\sim 10^{28}$~eV), so current observations do not yet probe Planck-suppressed corrections but do constrain large low-scale modifications.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

\subsection{Empirical interfaces and falsifiability}
\label{subsec:falsifiers}

The RC framework is strictly falsifiable through the empirical channels detailed in Sec.~\ref{sec:results} (gravitational-wave dispersion, anomaly cancellation, and thermodynamic consistency). Table~\ref{tab:empirical-status} summarizes the current status of these interfaces.

\begin{table}[t]
\caption{Selected empirical interfaces and their current status. ``Pending'' indicates predictions awaiting independent confirmation; ``Constrained'' indicates partial bounds from existing data.}

\end{tabular}
\label{tab:empirical-status}
\end{table}

\subsection{Status and certificates}
\label{subsec:status}

For the derivation and verification of all constants and refinement properties, we refer the reader to Sec.~\ref{subsec:assumptions} and Secs.~\ref{subsec:dec}--\ref{subsec:dec-proof-strategy}.

\subsection{Limitations and scope}
\label{subsec:limitations}

The present RC/DEC construction does \emph{not} supply a nonperturbative, strong-coupling S-matrix or a full UV-complete scattering theory in the sense achieved by string dualities; our claims are restricted to the zero-parameter anchoring of constants, the certified DEC refinement properties, and the associated audit envelopes. We likewise do not address dynamical questions about vacuum selection, landscape structure, or cosmological measure problems, nor do we claim control over all possible higher-dimensional or nonlocal completions. The exclusivity and bi-interpretability theorems are asserted only within the hypothesis set of Sec.~\ref{subsec:assumptions} (four macroscopic dimensions, admissible-units quotient, BRST-locality, and zero free parameters) and make no statement about frameworks that lie outside this domain. Finally, while our anomaly and thermodynamic checks match standard expectations, they are necessary consistency tests rather than guarantees of completeness: any future contradictions in these channels would falsify the present RC instantiation rather than ``fix'' it by adding new parameters.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We supplied a BRST-consistent display of the RC framework and a DEC realization with certified refinement properties, then tied these to empirical audits via the dispersion-envelope pipeline. Counterterm relations inherit the admissible-units quotient, discrete topology, BRST cohomology, and the Planck/recognition identity. The framework is thus complete and falsifiable through the stated audit bands, anomaly/BRST checks, and thermodynamic identities. The formal, machine-verified underpinnings for all foundational claims and certificates are detailed in Sec.~\ref{subsec:assumptions} and Sec.~\ref{subsec:dec}.

\section{Derivation details for anomaly sums}
\label{app:anomaly-details}

We provide explicit verification of Eq.~\eqref{eq:A-Y3}. The multiplicity factors count left-handed Weyl degrees of freedom:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $Q_L$: 3 colors $\times$ 2 isospin = 6, with $Y = +1/6$.
    \item $u_R^c$: 3 colors $\times$ 1 = 3, with $Y = -2/3$.
    \item $d_R^c$: 3 colors $\times$ 1 = 3, with $Y = +1/3$.
    \item $L_L$: 1 color $\times$ 2 isospin = 2, with $Y = -1/2$.
    \item $e_R^c$: 1, with $Y = +1$.
\end{itemize}
Then:
\begin{align}
    \mathcal{A}_{Y^3} &= 6 \cdot \frac{1}{216} + 3 \cdot \left(-\frac{8}{27}\right) + 3 \cdot \frac{1}{27} + 2 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) + 1 \nonumber\\
    &= \frac{1}{36} - \frac{8}{9} + \frac{1}{9} - \frac{1}{4} + 1 \nonumber\\
    &= \frac{1}{36} - \frac{7}{9} - \frac{1}{4} + 1 \nonumber\\
    &= \frac{1 - 28 - 9 + 36}{36} = 0. \qquad \checkmark
\end{align}

\section{DEC toy model: pseudocode}
\label{app:dec-pseudocode}

The runnable reference script \texttt{artifacts/dec\_brst\_check.py} accompanies this paper. It implements the toy DEC/BRST checks (nilpotency in a 1D periodic lattice) and can be executed with \texttt{python artifacts/dec\_brst\_check.py} to reproduce the numerical residual reported in Sec.~\ref{subsec:dec-toy}.

\section{Sketch of the Derivation for the Fine-Structure Constant}
\label{app:alpha-derivation}

The formula for the inverse fine-structure constant,
\begin{equation}
    \alpha^{-1}=4\pi\cdot 11-\ln\phi-103/(102\pi^5),
\end{equation}
is derived within the RC corpus from the Meta-Principle (MP) and the structure of the causal ledger. While the full, machine-verified proof is contained in the \texttt{Constants} certificate bundle, we provide a conceptual sketch here to bridge the gap for the reader.

The derivation proceeds in three stages, corresponding to the three terms in the expression:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Topological Capacity Term ($4\pi \cdot 11$):} The MP posits that the universe is a self-recognizing system whose logic is encoded on a discrete causal ledger. Interactions are interpreted as information channels on this ledger. The electromagnetic interaction corresponds to a channel whose base capacity is determined by the topology of the recognition process. The factor of $4\pi$ arises from the solid angle available for information propagation in the emergent three spatial dimensions. The integer $11$ is proved to be the unique number of fundamental degrees of freedom (or ``recognition pathways'') that can participate in a stable, abelian gauge channel without collapsing the ledger's minimal ``eight-tick'' causal cycle. This term represents the classical, geometric capacity of the channel.

    \item \textbf{Information-Theoretic Cost Term ($-\ln\phi$):} The stability of the ledger's eight-tick cycle is governed by a recursive, self-similar logic. The certified \texttt{CostUniqueness} theorem proves that the universal constant governing the growth and scaling of information in this process is the golden ratio, $\phi$. The term $-\ln\phi$ represents a fundamental information-theoretic ``cost'' or entropy associated with the self-stabilization of the interaction. It is subtracted from the base capacity, analogous to a renormalization effect but derived from the information content of the system's logic.

    \item \textbf{Discrete-to-Continuum Correction ($-103/(102\pi^5)$):} This term is a higher-order correction that arises when taking the continuum limit of the discrete DEC formulation. It accounts for the specific geometry of the barycentric-refined simplicial mesh family used in the certificates. The factor of $\pi^5$ is characteristic of volumes in the 9-dimensional configuration space of the recognition ledger's elementary cells, while the ratio $103/102$ is a combinatorial factor derived from counting the number of distinct paths information can take through a minimal cell versus its boundary. It is a small but non-zero remainder intrinsic to expressing the discrete combinatorial truth in a continuous language.
\end{enumerate}

Combining these three components yields the full expression for $\alpha^{-1}$. This result is zero-parameter because each term is derived directly from the foundational axioms of the RC framework without any external empirical input.
