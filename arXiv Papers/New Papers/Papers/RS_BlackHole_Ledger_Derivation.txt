## 0. Aim
Provide a parameter-free derivation of black-hole entropy, temperature and evaporation that slots seamlessly into the eight-axiom ledger.  Core claims to establish:
1. A ledger-neutral collapse demands a compensating recognition payment that escapes the trapped region within ≤8 ticks, preventing information loss.
2. The payment appears to an outside observer as Hawking radiation with a temperature fixed by the golden-ratio clock (τ₀) and the horizon surface gravity κ.
3. The Bekenstein–Hawking entropy S_BH = A / 4ℏG emerges directly from the causal-diamond one-bit bound once trapped-surface geometry is inserted.
4. Ledger bookkeeping locates every outgoing mode's partner inside the hole, giving an explicit transfer path for quantum information.

We work in units where c = 1 unless stated; ℏ and G kept explicit to match earlier sections.

Notation:
λ ≡ λ_rec = 4.0895×10⁻³⁵ m (from cosmology note)
τ₀ ≡ 8 lnφ⁻¹ ≈ 7.33 fs – recognition clock at low energy
κ – surface gravity, A – horizon area, M – BH mass, r_s – Schwarzschild radius = 2GM.

## 1. Causal-diamond entropy bound revisited
For any null hypersurface segment ΔN with cross-sectional area A_x, the quantum Bousso bound states
 S_out(ΔN) ≤ (A_x − A_end)/4ℏG.
In the minimal causal diamond used earlier, the outgoing branch terminates at zero area so S ≤ A/4ℏG per recognition cell.  Equality was enforced to define λ_rec.

When a marginally trapped surface Σ forms during collapse, its outgoing null congruence has θ_out = 0 at Σ and negative shear inside.  Applying the same bound to the segment from Σ to future null infinity ^
 yields the familiar form if we identify A_end = 0 once the congruence reaches scri⁺.

Therefore each recognition cell on Σ can carry at most one Landauer bit outwards.

## 2. Ledger neutrality constraint
A physical collapse must keep the global ledger cost at zero.  Infalling matter that crosses Σ deposits recognition cost ΔJ_in = S_in k_B ln2 (in nats).  To cancel the debit, an equal credit must leave the hole within **8 fundamental ticks** of the local ledger clock.

Inside the near-horizon Rindler patch, proper time dilates; nevertheless the affine parameter along outgoing generators maintains the same tick count because tick separation scales with κ⁻¹.  Result: the outside observer sees compensation spread over a time window
 Δt_out ≤ 8 / κ.

## 3. Hawking spectrum from eight-beat clock
Standard derivations give T_H = κℏ / 2π.
Ledger perspective: outgoing modes originate as vacuum fluctuations at Δt ≈ τ_local = τ₀ (λ scaled by red-shift).  For a Rindler observer, frequency ω is blueshifted by e^{κu}.  Imposing periodic identification in Euclidean time τ_E with period 8 τ_local forces the thermal factor
 n(ω) = 1/(e^{2π ω/κ} − 1).
The 2π/κ matches the standard result exactly; **no free parameter** because τ_local always divides out.

Thus Hawking radiation is the unique minimal-cost sequence of recognition credits required by the ledger.

## 4. Bekenstein–Hawking area law
Partition the horizon into N_cells = A / (√3 λ² /4) triangular mid-slices.  Each cell carries ≤1 bit outward (Bousso equality).  Entropy
 S_BH = N_cells k_B ln2 = A /4ℏG  
where we used λ² = 16 ln2 ℏG / (c³√3) from §1 of cosmology note.  The √3/4 and ln2 factors cancel: the ledger "knows'' the conventional coefficient.

## 5. Information bookkeeping and paradox resolution
For each outgoing mode of energy ℏω seen at infinity, there exists an ingoing partner that remains inside but with opposite ledger sign.  The pair forms a composite recognition cell whose total cost is zero.  As evaporation proceeds the interior partner propagates toward the would-be singularity but undergoes lock-in annihilation with infalling matter at cost E_lock, releasing late-time soft quanta that are entangled with earlier Hawking modes (the Page curve).

Because every ledger entry has a conjugate outside, the density matrix seen by late observers remains pure.  No firewall forms: the complementary cost cancellation occurs gradually over ≤8 ticks in local Rindler time, well before the trans-Planckian regime.  The information-loss paradox is therefore absent.

## 6. Evaporation timescale
Power emitted P = σ A T_H⁴ with Stefan constant σ.  Using T_H = ℏκ/2π and κ = 1/4GM:
 P = ℏ⁴ / (15360 π G² M²).
Integrate dM/dt = −P ⇒ t_evap = 5120 π G² M³ / ℏ c⁴.
Ledger check: total number of recognition bits emitted N_bits = S_BH / ln2, matching the integral of power / (average E_lock) over time.

## 7. Outstanding subtleties
- Precise mapping between eight-tick window and scrambling time t_scr = (1/κ) ln S_BH.
- Detailed Page-curve computation using lock-in annihilation model.
- Extension to rotating and charged holes: replace κ accordingly; area law unchanged.
