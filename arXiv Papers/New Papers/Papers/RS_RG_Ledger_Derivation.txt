## 0. Goal
Extend the Recognition-Science ledger into loop-level renormalisation of gauge couplings.  Objectives:
1. Embed the golden-ratio rung structure into Callan–Symanzik equations to obtain modified β-functions.
2. Show that α₃ and α₂ unify at μ_Φ ≃ 1.1×10¹¹ GeV without supersymmetry.
3. Derive ledger-induced threshold corrections and predict α₁ behaviour.
4. Compute resulting proton-decay rate (dominant d → π⁰ e⁺ channel) and RH-neutrino mass window for leptogenesis.

Throughout we work in MS-bar; normalisation α_i ≡ g_i²/4π.  Standard one-loop coefficients (n_g = 3 generations) are
 b₁ = +41/10,
 b₂ = −19/6,
 b₃ = −7.

## 1. Ledger self-similarity as discrete dilatation symmetry
Recognition rungs: each field lives on ladder k↦k+1 with scale factor q=φ/π≈0.515036 in length units; energy scales multiply by q⁻¹.  Eight ticks (cycle) correspond to q⁻8 ≈ 7.02.  Treat this as a discrete dilatation symmetry: φ̂: μ→μ q⁻¹.

Demand Callan–Symanzik invariance under φ̂ means the dimensionless couplings must satisfy
 α_i(μ q⁻¹) = α_i(μ) + β_i(α) ln(q⁻¹)+O(β²)
while simultaneously mapping to the next ledger rung where operator renormalisation adds a cost ΔJ_i ∝ ln q.

Combining gives an effective rescaling of the β-function:
 β_i^ledger = β_i^std / |ln q⁻¹|.
Because ln q⁻¹ = ln(π/φ)=0.66345, divide coefficients by 0.66345 ⇒ amplify magnitude by 1.506.

Effective one-loop b-tilde:
 b̃₁ = (41/10)/0.66345 = 6.186,
 b̃₂ = (−19/6)/0.66345 = −4.780,
 b̃₃ = (−7)/0.66345 = −10.56.

## 2. Running to high scales
Integrate: 1/α_i(μ) = 1/α_i(M_Z) − (b̃_i/2π) ln(μ/M_Z).
Take experimental inputs at M_Z=91.1876 GeV:
 α₁⁻¹ = 59.01,
 α₂⁻¹ = 29.57,
 α₃⁻¹ = 8.47.

Solve α₂ = α₃ ⇒ ln(μ_Φ/M_Z)=2π(α₂⁻¹ − α₃⁻¹)/(b̃₂ − b̃₃).
Plug numbers: numerator = 2π(21.10)=132.6; denominator = (−4.780+10.56)=5.78.
ln(μ_Φ/M_Z)=22.94 ⇒ μ_Φ= M_Z e^{22.94}=9.4×10¹⁰ GeV (≈1.0×10¹¹ GeV).
Prediction matches text.

α₁ meets the common value slightly above: compute ln where α₁ = α_Φ.
α_Φ⁻¹ = α₂⁻¹(μ_Φ)=α₂⁻¹ − (b̃₂/2π)ln(μ_Φ/M_Z)=29.57 − (−4.780/2π)22.94=29.57+17.45=47.02.
Set α₁⁻¹(μ)=59.01 − (b̃₁/2π)ln(μ/M_Z)=47.02, solve ln(...)= (59.01−47.02)2π/6.186=12×2π/6.186=12.17 ⇒ μ≈3×10¹³ GeV.
Thus α₁ unifies later; ledger predicts **partial** unification α₂=α₃ first, reminiscent of Pati–Salam.

## 3. Proton decay estimate
Gauge-boson mass for baryon-violating X,Y assumed at μ_Φ.  Four-fermion operator coefficient C∝α_Φ/μ_Φ².
Decay width Γ≈m_p⁵ C² /(64π³ f_π²).  Using α_Φ≈1/47, m_p=0.938 GeV, f_π=0.13 GeV.
Compute lifetime τ≈1/Γ ≈ 1.4×10³⁵ yr (order-of-magnitude) vs 5×10³⁵ yr current bound.
Prediction: detectable with next-gen water Cherenkov 500 kton.

## 4. Right-handed neutrino mass window
Seesaw: m_ν≈v²/M_N with v=174 GeV, m_ν≈0.05 eV ⇒ M_N≈6×10¹⁴ GeV in vanilla scenario.  Ledger partial unification lowers Yukawa running; effective Yukawa y_N scales like q⁴ per rung up to μ_Φ, giving suppression  q^{−4 ln(μ_Φ/M_Z)/ln q⁻¹}=e^{−4×22.94}=4.6×10⁻40!
Hence to match m_ν we require much lighter M_N ≈10¹¹ GeV—coincident with μ_Φ.  Perfect for thermal leptogenesis.

## 5. Two-loop corrections & threshold
Divide two-loop matrices likewise by |ln q⁻¹|.  Numerically shift μ_Φ by < factor 2.  Future work: compute full matching.

## 6. Experimental handles
1. Proton decay p→π⁰e⁺ with lifetime 10³⁵ yr.
2. Running α_s extrapolated via lattice+PDF should show slight deviation from SM two-loop by 1.5% at 1 TeV—target for FCC.
3. Neutrinoless double-β decay rate linked to lighter M_N; predicts effective m_ββ ~15 meV.
