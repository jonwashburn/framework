# Product README Template – Anti-Gravity Pillar

Copy this template into each product folder and replace the placeholders.  The same structure will be reused across all fifteen pillars so automation scripts can parse status and generate dashboards.

## 1. Concept Overview  
*One-paragraph elevator pitch that a venture capitalist understands.*

## 2. Key Performance Metrics  
| Metric | Target | Unit | Notes |
|--------|--------|------|-------|
| Field-Strength | <!-- e.g. 9.81 --> | N kg⁻¹ | Local gravity cancellation produced |
| Power Lift Ratio | <!-- e.g. 200 --> | kW t⁻¹ | Electrical power per metric-ton of cancelled weight |
| Endurance | <!-- e.g. 120 --> | min | Continuous operation on one energy pack |
| Payload | <!-- e.g. 120 --> | kg | Net useful load |

## 3. Technology Readiness Path  
Describe the experiment or prototype that earns TRL-5, TRL-6, etc.  List measurable acceptance criteria.

## 4. Cross-Pillar Dependencies  
List subsystems supplied by other pillars (e.g. quantum-substrate control electronics from pillar 02, torsion-skin metamaterial from pillar 08).

## 5. Regulatory & Safety  
Identify primary regulators (FAA, OSHA, ISO 18404) and the compliance tests planned.  Link to shared files in `/regulatory/` when available.

## 6. Patent Strategy & IP Landscape  
Bulleted list of provisional filings, prior art search status, and planned jurisdictions.

## 7. Functional Specifications  
Break down into subsystems (power, control, structure, user interface) with quantitative requirements.

## 8. Business Model  
TAM/SAM/SOM, pricing tiers, manufacturing cost targets, distribution channels.

## 9. User Stories  
Write at least two first-person scenarios that illustrate the product's value.
