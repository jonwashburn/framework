# Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) – Recognition Science Atlas

| TRL | Definition | Typical Evidence |
|-----|------------|------------------|
| 1 | Basic principles observed | Journal paper, simulation of phenomenon |
| 2 | Technology concept formulated | Analytical study, hypothesis linked to use-case |
| 3 | Experimental proof-of-concept | Bench demo validating core physics |
| 4 | Lab validation of component | Functioning prototype in controlled environment |
| 5 | Validation in relevant environment | Prototype tested with target loads/conditions |
| 6 | System/sub-system demonstration in relevant environment | Pilot prototype performing full mission subset |
| 7 | System demonstration in operational environment | Pre-production unit with regulatory waivers |
| 8 | Qualified system complete | Certification tests passed, manufacturing line established |
| 9 | Actual system proven in mission operations | Commercial service with customer feedback |
