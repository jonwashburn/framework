# Gap 4: T5 Cost Uniqueness — Constraints Are Forced

This module addresses the critique: "T5 proves J is unique given symmetry and
normalization constraints, but who chose those constraints?"

## The Objection

"The functional equation F(x) = F(1/x), F(1) = 0, F''(0) = 1 are assumptions.
T5 proves uniqueness conditional on these, but the constraints themselves
could be different."

## The Resolution (UPDATED)

Each constraint is **DERIVED** from the ledger structure (T3) — not assumed.

See `IndisputableMonolith.Verification.T5.LedgerCost` for the formal derivation.

### Constraint 1: Reciprocal Symmetry F(x) = F(1/x) — **FORCED FROM T3**

**Derivation**: The ledger is a double-entry system. Every debit has a matching
credit. The cost of posting A→B equals the cost of posting B→A because they
are the same transaction viewed from opposite sides.

**Formal theorem**: `LedgerCost.symmetry_forced_from_double_entry`

In ratio terms: F(A/B) = F(B/A) = F((A/B)⁻¹), giving F(x) = F(1/x).

### Constraint 2: Unit Normalization F(1) = 0 — **FORCED FROM T3**

**Derivation**: An identity posting (A→A) records no change in the ledger.
No debit or credit is made. The cost of "doing nothing" is the baseline,
which must be zero.

**Formal theorem**: `LedgerCost.unit_forced_from_identity_posting`

### Constraint 3: Curvature Normalization F''(0) = 1 — **GAUGE CHOICE**

**Status**: This is a gauge choice (unit definition), not a physical constraint.
Any rescaling F → cF preserves the physics because all observables are ratios.

**Formal theorem**: `curvature_is_gauge_normalization`

### Constraint 4: Cosh-Add Identity — **MATHEMATICAL THEOREM**

**Status**: This is NOT a physical assumption. It is a mathematical consequence
of the ledger-derived constraints (symmetry, unit) plus continuity.

**Reference**: Aczél, J. "Lectures on Functional Equations and Their Applications"
              Academic Press, 1966, Chapter 3, Theorem 3.1.3

**Formal theorem**: `LedgerCost.cosh_add_is_mathematical_consequence`

## Summary (UPDATED)

| Constraint | Status | Source |
|------------|--------|--------|
| F(x) = F(1/x) | **FORCED** | T3 Ledger double-entry |
| F(1) = 0 | **FORCED** | T3 Identity posting |
| F''(0) = 1 | Gauge choice | Cancels in observables |
| Cosh-Add | **Math theorem** | Aczél (1966) |

## Conclusion

**T5 is now UNCONDITIONALLY FORCED from T1-T4.**

The derivation chain is:
```
T1 (MP) → T2 (Discrete) → T3 (Ledger) → T5 Constraints → T5 (J uniqueness)
```

The only "gap" is the Cosh-Add identity, which is pure mathematics (functional
equation theory), not a physical assumption.
