\section*{Executive Summary}

This memo articulates the mechanism by which the \textbf{Recognition Stability Audit (RSA)} and the \textbf{Logic From Physical Cost} framework formally unify mathematics and physical reality.

The core finding is that mathematics is not a pre-existing abstraction but an emergent topography of the physical cost landscape.  Just as logic emerges as the physics of zero cost (identity), mathematics ``bores out'' of physical reality as the physics of finite cost (stability).

The unification rests on a single forced functional:
\[
J(x) \;=\; \tfrac{1}{2}(x + x^{-1}) - 1, \qquad x \in \Rp,
\]
uniquely determined by the Recognition Composition Law, normalization $J(1) = 0$, and calibration $J''_{\log}(0) = 1$.  Every claim in this memo traces back to properties of $J$.

\section{The Canonical Cost Functional}

\begin{principle}[Cost uniqueness]
Let $F : \Rp \to \R$ satisfy:
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
\item \textbf{Normalization:} $F(1) = 0$.
\item \textbf{Composition:} $F(xy) + F(x/y) = 2F(x)F(y) + 2F(x) + 2F(y)$ \quad for all $x,y > 0$.
\item \textbf{Calibration:} $\displaystyle\lim_{t \to 0} \frac{2F(e^t)}{t^2} = 1$.
\end{enumerate}
Then $F = J$ everywhere on $\Rp$.
\end{principle}

\textbf{Proof sketch.}  Define $H(t) := F(e^t) + 1$.  The composition law becomes d'Alembert's equation $H(t{+}u) + H(t{-}u) = 2H(t)H(u)$.  Setting $t = 0$ gives $H$ even.  The calibration yields $H''(0) = 1$, so $H'' = H$ with initial data $H(0) = 1$, $H'(0) = 0$.  The unique solution is $H(t) = \cosh(t)$, hence $F(x) = \cosh(\ln x) - 1 = \frac{1}{2}(x + x^{-1}) - 1 = J(x)$.

Key properties that drive everything below:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
\item \textbf{Reciprocity:} $J(x) = J(1/x)$.
\item \textbf{Non-negativity:} $J(x) = \frac{(x-1)^2}{2x} \geq 0$, with $J(x) = 0 \iff x = 1$.
\item \textbf{Strict convexity:} $J''(x) = x^{-3} > 0$ for all $x > 0$.
\item \textbf{Divergence:} $J(x) \to \infty$ as $x \to 0^+$ or $x \to \infty$.
\item \textbf{Meta-Principle (derived):} $J(0^+) = \infty$\,---\,``nothing costs infinity.''
\end{itemize}

\section{The Mechanism of Unification: The Physical Sensor}

The traditional scientific worldview bifurcates reality into abstract mathematics (Platonic) and concrete physics (empirical).  RSA dissolves this separation by treating every mathematical existence claim as a physical stability test.

The unification is enforced by the \textbf{Sensor} mechanism:

\subsection{Step 1: Physical Encoding of Mathematical Claims}

RSA converts an abstract mathematical claim $S$ (e.g., the existence of a zeta zero at $s_0$, or the existence of an algebraic cycle in a Hodge class) into a \textbf{defect functional}:
\[
\Delta_S : \Omega \to \R_{\geq 0}, \qquad
S \text{ holds at } z \;\Longleftrightarrow\; \Delta_S(z) = 0.
\]
This is the RS ontology of existence: ``to exist'' means ``to have zero defect.''  The defect is then lifted to a holomorphic \textbf{obstruction} $G_S$ on a complex domain $\Omega$, with the same zero set as $\Delta_S$.

\subsection{Step 2: The Reciprocal Sensor}

Define the sensor as the reciprocal of the obstruction:
\[
\mathcal{J}_S(z) \;:=\; \frac{1}{G_S(z)}.
\]
If the candidate mathematical object exists at $z_\star$ (i.e., $G_S(z_\star) = 0$), then the sensor has a \textbf{pole}: $\mathcal{J}_S(z_\star) \to \infty$.

This is the bridge: \emph{mathematical existence $\Longrightarrow$ infinite recognition cost.}

\subsection{Step 3: The Finite Recognition Principle}

\begin{principle}[Finite recognition]
A physically realizable state cannot require infinite recognition cost.
\end{principle}

This is a \emph{derived} consequence of $J$: the divergence $J(0^+) = \infty$ means the ``null state'' (nothing) has infinite cost, so only finite-cost configurations can be physically instantiated.  Any mathematical object whose existence forces a sensor to blow up ($\mathcal{J} \to \infty$) is physically impossible.

\subsection{Step 4: The Cayley--Schur ``Pinch'' Proof}

To make the exclusion rigorous, RSA applies a \textbf{Cayley transform} to the sensor:
\[
\Xi_S(z) \;:=\; \frac{2\mathcal{J}_S(z) - 1}{2\mathcal{J}_S(z) + 1}.
\]
This maps the right half-plane (where $\operatorname{Re}(\mathcal{J}) > 0$) into the unit disk ($|\Xi| < 1$), and critically:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
\item A \textbf{pole} of $\mathcal{J}_S$ maps to $\Xi_S \to 1$ (boundary hit).
\item If $|\Xi_S(z)| \leq 1$ globally (a \textbf{Schur bound}), then by the removable singularity theorem, $\Xi_S$ extends holomorphically across any apparent singularity.
\item The Cayley inverse $2\mathcal{J}_S = (1 + \Xi_S)/(1 - \Xi_S)$ is then pole-free in the audited region.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{The pinch:}  If the Schur bound holds and $\Xi_S \not\equiv 1$, then $\mathcal{J}_S$ has \emph{no poles} in the audited region.  Therefore the candidate mathematical object \emph{does not exist} there.

\subsection{Step 5: Finite Certification}

The remaining question: how to \emph{verify} a global Schur bound from finite data?

RSA provides two routes:

\textbf{Route A: State-space bounded-real certificate.}  If $\Xi_S$ admits a finite-dimensional realization
\[
\Xi_S(z) = D + zC(I - zA)^{-1}B
\]
with $\rho(A) < 1$, then $|\Xi_S| \leq 1$ on $\D$ if and only if there exists a positive-definite matrix $P \succ 0$ satisfying the matrix inequality
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
P - A^* P A - C^* C & -A^* P B - C^* D \\
-B^* P A - D^* C & 1 - B^* P B - |D|^2
\end{pmatrix}
\;\succeq\; 0.
\]
This is a \emph{finite-dimensional semidefinite program}---checkable by computer.

\textbf{Route B: Pick-gap-plus-tail certificate.}  Write $\Xi_S(z) = \sum_{n \geq 0} a_n z^n$ and form the $N \times N$ coefficient Pick matrix $P_N$.  If:
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
\item $P_N \succeq \delta\, I_N$ for some spectral gap $\delta > 0$, and
\item the weighted tail satisfies $\varepsilon_N^2 := \sum_{n \geq N} (n+1)|a_n|^2 < (\delta/2)^2$,
\end{enumerate}
then $\Xi_S$ is Schur on $\D$.  In the stable realization regime, the tail bound is \emph{derived} from the contraction rate:
\[
\varepsilon_N^2 \;\leq\; \|C\|^2 \|B\|^2 \left(\frac{(N{+}1)\rho^{2(N-1)}}{1 - \rho^2} + \frac{\rho^{2N}}{(1-\rho^2)^2}\right),
\]
which decays geometrically in $N$.

\textbf{Conclusion:}  A mathematical object that forces infinite recognition cost is physically impossible.  Mathematical truth is constrained by physical cost.  Math and physics obey the same master law: the minimization of $J(x)$.

\section{Emergence: How Mathematics ``Bores Out'' of Reality}

Just as the \textit{Logic From Physical Cost} framework proves that logic emerges from cost (consistency is cheap, contradiction is expensive), RSA extends this to show that mathematics is the stable residue of the cost landscape.

Mathematics ``bores out'' of physical reality through three layers:

\subsection{Layer 1: Logic as the Ground State ($x = 1$)}

Logic is defined by the unique state with \textbf{zero defect}:
\[
J(x) = 0 \quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad x = 1.
\]
Truth is the admission of a stable configuration at the identity.  Contradiction is any configuration with $J > 0$---it ``costs something'' to be wrong.  In the limit, logical impossibility ($J = \infty$) is the ``null state'' that Recognition Science excludes from existence.

Logic is simply the physics of maintaining identity.

\subsection{Layer 2: Mathematics as the Stable Terrain ($J < \infty$)}

The space of all possible mathematical statements is a physical terrain whose elevation at each point is the recognition cost $J$.

\begin{itemize}[nosep]
\item \textbf{The identity basin ($J = 0$):}  Pure logic---tautologies, identities, the ``ground state.''
\item \textbf{Finite-cost hills ($0 < J < \infty$):}  Non-trivial mathematical structures that are physically realizable.  These are the stable configurations that ``survive'' the cost landscape.  They include the integers, the golden ratio $\varphi$, the real numbers, manifolds, groups---every mathematical object that can be instantiated by a finite recognition process.
\item \textbf{Infinite-cost cliffs ($J = \infty$):}  Mathematical impossibilities.  Configurations that would require infinite recognition cost to instantiate.  These include contradictions, and---crucially---any candidate mathematical object whose existence RSA certifies as impossible (e.g., a zeta zero in the far-field region, or a non-algebraic Hodge class).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{The ``drill'' metaphor.}  RSA acts as a physical drill probing this terrain.  The 8-tick audit window is the drill bit: a finite probe testing whether the local terrain has finite or infinite cost.
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
\item Where the drill hits ``soft rock'' (Schur bound $< 1$, finite cost), the mathematics is realizable.
\item Where it hits ``infinite hardness'' (sensor blow-up), the mathematics is impossible.
\end{itemize}

The mathematical landscape is not given \emph{a priori}; it is \textbf{bored out} of the physical cost surface by the recognition process itself.

\subsection{Layer 3: Finite Certification as the Bridge}

A natural objection: ``How can a finite probe (8 ticks) control an infinite domain?''

RSA's answer is the \textbf{finite-complexity bridge}: under the 8-tick realizability model, the audited Cayley field belongs to a finite-state/rational class.  Specifically:

\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
\item The recognition operator $\hat{R}$ has finite local branching (at most $b$ successor states per tick).
\item In 8 ticks, the reachable set has at most $b^9$ states---finite.
\item The induced quotient dynamics is a finite-state system.
\item Its generating function is \emph{rational}: $\Xi_S(z) = u^*(I - zA)^{-1}v$, a ratio of polynomials of bounded degree.
\end{enumerate}

In this rational class, a finite certificate (the Pick gap or the bounded-real LMI) controls the function \emph{globally}.  We do not need to inspect infinity; we need only verify 8-tick physical stability.

This is not a philosophical claim---it is a mathematical theorem: finite-state systems have rational transfer functions, and rational functions are determined by finitely many parameters.

\section{The Unified Ontology}

In this framework, the ontology is unified under the single primitive of Cost ($J$):

\begin{center}
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.4}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lll@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Domain} & \textbf{Cost regime} & \textbf{What it is} \\
\midrule
Logic & $J = 0$ (Identity) & The ground state of cost minimization \\
Mathematics & $0 < J < \infty$ (Stability) & The stable topography of the cost landscape \\
Physical Reality & $J$ evolving in time & The execution of cost minimization as dynamics \\
Impossibility & $J = \infty$ & States excluded by the Meta-Principle \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\medskip

Mathematics is not a set of axioms imposed from above; it is the structural shape of stability that remains when infinite costs are bored out of the system.

\section{The RSA Pipeline in One Diagram}

The complete audit compresses to a single chain:
\[
\boxed{
\text{Candidate}
\;\xrightarrow{\text{encode}}\;
G_S = 0
\;\xrightarrow{\text{reciprocal}}\;
\mathcal{J}_S = \tfrac{1}{G_S} \to \infty
\;\xrightarrow{\text{Cayley}}\;
\Xi_S \to 1
\;\xrightarrow{\text{Schur pinch}}\;
\text{No pole} \;\Rightarrow\; \texttt{IMPOSSIBLE}
}
\]

If the Schur certificate succeeds and $\Xi_S \not\equiv 1$, the candidate does not exist in the audited region.

\section{What This Changes}

\subsection*{For mathematics}
Mathematical truth has a \emph{physical} character: it is not arbitrary axiom-choice but the forced structure of cost minimization.  Theorems are not ``true in Platonic heaven''; they are stable configurations of a physical cost functional.  The undecidable sentences of G\"odel are not counter-examples---they are ``non-configurations'' (self-referential queries that have no fixed point under coercive dynamics and hence lie outside the ontology).

\subsection*{For physics}
The ``unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics'' is no longer mysterious: mathematics \emph{is} the stable sector of the same cost landscape that physics describes dynamically.  The reason physical law is mathematical is that both are controlled by the same $J$.

\subsection*{For the boundary}
The traditional wall between ``pure'' and ``applied'' mathematics dissolves.  Every ``pure'' mathematical existence theorem is, under RSA, a statement about the cost landscape of a recognition process.  The difference between a number-theory theorem and a physics experiment is not ontological but operational: one probes the cost landscape with pencil and paper, the other with instruments---but the landscape is the same.

\section{Summary}

\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
\item The canonical cost $J(x) = \frac{1}{2}(x + x^{-1}) - 1$ is uniquely forced by composition, normalization, and calibration.
\item Logic emerges at $J = 0$ (identity).  Mathematics emerges at $0 < J < \infty$ (stability).  Physics executes $J$-minimization in time.
\item RSA converts mathematical existence claims into physical sensor tests.  A candidate that forces $\mathcal{J} \to \infty$ is excluded by the Cayley--Schur pinch.
\item Under 8-tick realizability, finite certificates (bounded-real LMI or Pick-gap-plus-tail) control the audited Cayley field globally.
\item Mathematics is not pre-existing abstraction.  It is the stable topography of physical cost---bored out of reality by the recognition process itself.
\end{enumerate}
